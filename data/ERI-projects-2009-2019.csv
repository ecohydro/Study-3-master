4p,Ralph Archuleta Chen Ji,10/1/17,3/31/18,49747,California Department of Conservation,"California state, municipal agencies",1017-561,Strong Ground Motion from Earthquakes on Multiple Faults,InSAR image and geological surveys demonstrate that Kaikoura earthquake resulted in slip on multiple (>12) fault segments (https://info.geonet.org.nz/display/quake/2016/12). InSAR cannot conclusively determine that all of these segments ruptured co-seismically. We propose a two-step approach to constrain the co-seismic rupture. We first investigate the co-seismic moment rate distribution using strong motion records with the multiple double-couple (MDC) approach discussed above. We assume each potential fault segments as one double-couple point source and invert for its seismic moment centroid location centroid time and rupture duration for each fault segment using teleseismic and far-field strong motion waveforms. The results will provide the spatial moment distribution and temporal distribution of point sources. When the causative fault segments are constrained we conduct finite fault inversion on a fault geometry with predefined fault segments using broadband seismic data as we did for 2008 Wenchuan and 2016 Kumamoto earthquakes. As the seismic data with higher frequency is included the fault slip is refined. ,2017,2018

Actions will be undertaken to reestablish three Rana sierrae populations in the portion of the Desolation Wilderness managed by the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit. This work will continue efforts conducted during 2013-2016 that included translocations of adults and egg masses from the Rivendell source population (Eldorado National Forest) to Lake Lucille and/or Jabu Lake in 2013 and 2014 collection of eggs and/or metamorphs from the Rivendell source population in 2013 and 2014 for captive rearing at the San Francisco Zoo and reintroduction of captive-reared adults to Lake Lucille and/or Tamarack Lake in 2014 2015 and 2016. Insufficient time has elapsed to determine the outcome of these efforts. During the current project (11/1/2016-10/31/2019) we will continue efforts to establish self-sustaining R. sierrae populations at Jabu Lake Lake Lucille and Tamarack Lake. This will be accomplished via translocalions and reintroductions of captive-reared frogs. All populations will be intensively monitored using capture-markrecapture (CMR) methods. On completion this project will provide key insights into the feasibility of restoring R. sierrae to this portion of the Desolation Wilderness allow comparisons of the success of frog translocation versus captive rearing/reintroduction and make recommendations regarding recovery methods that should be considered in future R. sierrae recovery efforts both in the Desolation Wilderness and across the species' native range. ,2017,2019
6p,Karl Rittger,6/1/18,12/31/19,331195,California Department of Fish and Wildlife,"California state, municipal agencies",,High Resolution Snow Cover Maps for Quantifying Winter Habitat for Wildlife,Optical remote sensing can accurately provide much needed information on snow cover and snowpack; specifically we can derive snow cover and snow albedo from these instruments. Since March of 2000 the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) has provided daily images of the entire Earths surface. Historically MOD10 snow cover and albedo based on simple algorithms such as the Normalized Snow Difference Index (NDSI) have been used. However NDSI uses only parts of the electromagnetic spectrum available from Earth observing satellites while recent developments in modeling snow properties utilize innovative algorithms that take advantage of the full spectrum. Unlike NDSI these modern algorithms in this case MODIS Snow Covered Area and Grain Size (MODSCAG) maintain their performance over a broader range of land surfaces especially mountainous terrain during accumulation and in spring and summer when snow is most heterogeneous (Rittger et al. 2013). The proposed work includes adapting and introducing statistical methodology for fusing Landsat and MODIS satellite data. In particular the blended product will be daily optimal statistical estimates of snow cover at the 30m Landsat resolution but that are consistent with the coarse 500m MODIS estimates. This will be accomplished by utilizinggeneralized additive models robust feature engineering techniques from machine learning and spatial stochastic modeling that accounts for uncertainty in the fused products. ,2018,2019

The project is projected to sequester 549 metric tons (t) of carbon over the first 100 years of establishment and to contribute to the science of quantifying the greenhouse gas (GHG) sequestration potential of intermittently tidal coastal estuary systems through a research and monitoring program. Anticipated fish and wildlife co-benefits include supporting recovery plan recommendations for federal and state threatened and endangered species by providing expanded and improved habitat for the Tidewater Goby (TWG) Western Snowy Plover California Least Tern California Red-legged Frog Ventura Marsh Milk Vetch and Beldings Savannah Sparrow. In addition expanded habitat for migratory shorebirds and waterfowl and resident wetland and upland bird species will be created. Ecosystem benefits include reducing localized flooding problems and disturbance associated with flood control management activities improving downstream water quality through expansion of wetlands and bioswale systems within the urban to wetland interface and supporting expanded carbon sequestration denitrification and other microbial processes. Educational benefits from this project are significant because of its location on the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB) campus with its rotating student body of 20000 students active academic research and hands-on restoration implementation and training program run by the Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration (CCBER). In addition the project site borders a relatively dense urban area (City of Goleta and the community of Isla Vista) and 652 acres of recently protected coastal open space. A trail system will be developed through the restoration project site which will connect the community to the recreational amenities of this protected open space and the beach. ,2015,2020

These include reduction in flood risk to habitats and property currently within 100 year flood zone and vulnerable to projections for 3 feet of sea level rise provision of long-term support for diverse threatened and endangered species improvements in water quality greenhouse gas sequestration and the provision of educational and public access benefits for students and members of Isla Vista a disadvantaged community in Santa Barbara County. Funds will support the implementation of the majority of the wetland-related restoration components of the full project. CDFW Proposition 1 grant funds will specifically fund the: a) removal of approximately 40000 cy of the 300000 cy that will be removed with other secured funding b) implementation of fine grading and restoration actions to support the conservation of 18 acres salt marsh habitat in the face of sea level rise and 3) construction and restoration of habitat features in support of federally endangered tidewater goby migratory shorebirds and special status birds and plants.

9p,Carol Blanchette Marion Wittmann,6/13/19,3/15/21,506800,California Department of Forestry,"California state, municipal agencies",5GA18206,Valentine Reserve Fuel Reduction,Valentine Reserve is an ecological reserve and research station owned and operated by the University of California. The Reserve is located at the wildland urban interface (WUI) between the resort Town of Mammoth Lakes and the Inyo National Forest. Wildfire has been suppressed on the Reserve for approximately 150 years. Historical records show that average fire recurrence intervals before that time at the Valentine Reserve were as frequent as 15 years. Very high loading of fuel has accumulated and the forest is in a very unhealthy condition with excessive stand density (up to 900 stems/acre). We propose a hazardous fuels reduction project on 50 acres of high-density forest within the reserve to increase the health and resilience of the forest and to reduce potential future wildfire severity and protect developed infrastructure in the Town of Mammoth Lakes CA. Having a large natural forest preserve in such proximity to a tourist-based semi-urban community requires special attention to both the work prescribed and the methods employed for performing the work. The WUI at Valentine Reserve will require a mixture of approaches in order to achieve fuels reduction goals oriented around preservation conservation and wildfire safety. This includes the establishing of sustainable tree spacing the maintenance and preservation of a diversity of tree age and tree species and a sensitivity to wildlife habitat. This project will incorporate forest treatment prescriptions oriented around the following: selective thinning of small conifer trees by hand felling; selective removal of dead trees; removal of trees infested with bark beetles; pole saw work (raising) in some densely forested areas in order to reduce ladder fuels; and finally some raking in areas of excessive ground fuel accumulation. Treatment of the fuels material will likely be a mixture of on-site chipping complete removal to be processed and chipped at a remote green-waste facility and some minimal piling and burning. A variety of equipment types will be used in order to move the material out of the area. A minimal impact approach on the landscape will be followed as much as practical and possible throughout the project. Finally all commercially viable and useable material will be removed and processed locally for either firewood or building material. ,2019,2021

UCSB supports the establishment of multi-modal public trails on the site but has no dedicated resources for this development. Through an ongoing community-based planning process it became clear that the community has a strong desire for trails and public access across the land for wildlife and open space appreciation and passive recreation including walking cycling jogging and as a safe route to school. With funding from the Active Transportation Program the trail would provide both educational opportunities and access to bus stops public schools and UCSB and to trails located on Ellwood Mesa and other portions of the adjacent 652-acre preserve (part of the Ellwood Devereux Open Space). ,2017,2020

The 136 acre North Campus Open Space Restoration Project is underway and is unearthing 40 acres of wetlands buried in the 1960s and restoring historic land forms and a diversity of native plant communities and wildlife habitat using only locally sourced native plant material. The project includes 2.5 miles of trails and four wetland crossings funded by CalTrans Alternative Transportation Program under contract now. The crucial need now is for an interpretive trailhead area with benches shade plantings and interpretive signage as well as trailside amenities such as benches and signage to enhance the educational value of the site for the diverse users of the area. An exhibit case that can support changing exhibits and a native ethno-botanical garden supported by downloadable audio pod-casts with Native American stories chants and songs will supplement traditional signage to keep the facility current and living. The project site forms a gateway to a larger coastal open space by connecting people via bus routes bike and walking paths student residences and community members from median income and disadvantaged neighborhoods. Funded primarily by grants with a long term management commitment by the university this project will provide valuable educational and experiential learning opportunities regarding Californias natural resources and the value of wetlands to the States future leaders and voters.

New DNA-based technologies can assist in determining if fecal pollution is associated with human waste and thus human pathogens or if other animal hosts or natural sources explain. Further such technologies if applied in a watershed context within a qualified field study design can enable determining fecal sources e.g. failed civil infrastructure whose repair by owners can remedy the pollution and restore water quality. To date several beaches in the Santa Barbara area have been researched for fecal pollution since fecal indicator bacteria concentrations in coastal waters were chronically elevated. Three beaches in Santa Barbara remain a high priority as determined by the Clean Beach Initiative in CA: East Beach at Sycamore Leadbetter Beach and Goleta Beach. In this project the lower watersheds of each beach will be characterized for sources of fecal pollution including evaluating infrastructure location and age. Hypotheses will be developed regarding potential fecal sources that impinge on surf zone water quality. Hypotheses will be tested using state of the art approaches in microbial source tracking applied within a field sampling program for each beach. Results will be used to inform stakeholders i.e. water quality and infrastructure managers in the region regarding sources that can subsequently be remediated. This is a three year project that builds on expertise in the Holden Lab group previously demonstrated in various State of CA clean beach initiatives and in the Santa Barbara region. ,2015,2019

Our collaborators at UC Berkeley (Max Moritz and postdoc) will evaluate cover changes (trees to shrubs) and their consequences in Sierran watersheds while the UCSB group will focus on southern California coastal mountain ranges and eco-hydrological modeling. At UCSB we will use a combination of historic aerial photos GIS and fire occurrence records to evaluate factors contributing to watershed conversion in order to project areas vulnerable to future change. To study the consequences of land cover change we will select relatively fine-scale study areas to be compared stratified according to those that are dominated by native species and those that have largely been type converted into non-native invasive species. Local scale measurements of water infiltration vegetation evapotranspiration and soil surface conditions will be used to parameterize watershed scale models to predict changes in water yield and nitrate run-off relative to vegetation condition. Small scale measurements will be used to parameterize and test the ecosystem watershed model RhesSys to evaluate the potential for largescale changes in water yield due to land cover change. RhesSys models will be developed for both the Sierran watersheds and a southern California watershed. ,2011,2015

However due to the current lack of regulation chemical content disclosure and consumer awareness most manufacturers have little incentive to replace chemicals-of-concern (COCs) with safer alternatives. Assembly Bill 1879 requires DTSC to develop the Safer Consumer Products Regulations that establish a process to identify products that pose high risk to humans and the environment. Once identified the regulations require manufacturers to evaluate safer alternatives to COCs in those products by following an AA protocol and considering the impacts of the COCs and alternative formulations from life cycle (LC) perspective. By integrating LC thinking into the AA manufacturers can avoid shifting environmental burdens and making environmentally unfavorable substitutions. California State regulations permit DTSC to compile a list of 1200 candidate COCs. The list of candidate chemicals can be found at http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/SCP/ChemList.cfm. DTSC must identify consumer products containing COCs and compile guidance for AA. The regulations apply to any COC  containing product sold distributed supplied or manufactured for sale in California. In March of 2014 DTSC issued a list of 3 high-priority products of concern.

We will map erosional and depositional landforms from recent aerial LiDAR images and historical aerial photographs into a GIS and conduct field measurements and other analyses. Specific questions to address through development of a rapid sediment budget (Reid and Dunne 1996) for various time periods include: 1) what are the significant active geomorphic processes (e.g. gullies slides incision) that deliver sediment to channels? 2) how do current and/or historical landuse activities influence sediment delivery rates relative to pre-disturbance natural background rates? 3) have landuse activities caused significant changes in channel sediment storage and sediment supply in alluvial channel reaches and or significant changes in the rate of sediment supply to the lagoon? 4) what are the relationships between grain size distributions in channels and bed mobility pool filling and sediment supply rate? Addressing these questions will increase our knowledge about the effects of anthropogenic and climate disturbances on geomorphic processes at the scale of a small coastal California watershed. ,2014,2015

The forest distribution and structure (i.e. height and density of the trees and their location and orientation) can have profound effects on the distribution of snow. In coordination with the 59000 acre interagency Lake Tahoe West Project (LTWP) led by the U.S. Forest Service we propose expanded scientific studies and modeling in the Tahoe-Truckee Basin that develop watershed-scale forest thinning strategies to enhance streamflow within a critical area for water and threatened species. The primary goal of this project is to develop actionable information for managers to retain snow on the landscape in ways that delay the stream hydrograph and improve the quantity and quality of summer low flows when aquatic ecosystems are most stressed. We will use three project objectives to meet this goal and achieve streamflow enhancement in numerous watersheds: 1) Determine optimum watershed-scale forest thinning strategies for the LTWP to enhance streamflow by retaining snow in key parts of the landscape 2) Provide baseline streamflow monitoring and develop tools to quantify the effects of forest treatments on streamflow and limiting factors for ecology across diverse watersheds 3) Develop 25- and 50-year forest management strategies in key watersheds to ensure streamflow enhancement gains under the combined effects of climate change drought and forest disturbance. ,2018,2022

At the shallow outflow discharge location fresh (i.e. buoyant compared with ambient ocean saltwater) plume waters are expected to quickly rise to the ocean surface (top few meters). Drifters drogued at 1meter depth provide a direct measure of transport pathways taken by surface water parcels. CTD measurements following drifter motion give a direct measure of effluent plume dilution as fresh plume waters mix with ambient saltwater. Primary goals of the proposed study are: 1. Make repeated direct measurements of effluent plume pathways from the diffuser location with water-following drifters. 2. Make repeated direct measurement of plume concentration (via salinity) following plume (drifter) motion. 3. Identify where (and if) plume waters (as tracked with drifters) reach the offshore edge of the surf zone and indicate corresponding plume concentration. 4.

The overall and long-term goal is to improve microbiological water quality and public health at Santa Barbara beaches which are very popular recreational and tourism destinations. ,2014,2015
26p,Patricia Holden,11/8/16,1/31/18,29999,City of Santa Barbara,"California state, municipal agencies",21700093,Research in New Source Detection,In urban coastal zones where cities have variably aged sanitary sewer and municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4s) untreated sewage can migrate from sanitary sewer defects through subsoil and into nearby storm drains.Such subsurface communication between these separate pipe systems threatens coastal water quality since storm drains discharge to creeks that flow to the ocean. There is some evidence that the proximity of leaking sanitary sewers to storm drains including where sanitary sewers cross over storm drains may influence sanitary sewer contamination to MS4s. We previously showed this by real time studies using rhodamine WT dye released into sanitary sewers and probing dye fluorescence continuously in a nearby storm drain coupled with sampling and analyzing for molecular evidence of human waste. In a separate study we showed that populating a pipe leakage algorithm with GIS-based sanitary sewer system information (i.e. pipe material diameter and depth)—for pipes with invert depths within 3 m of the shallow groundwater table—allowed for explaining wastewater contamination in shallow groundwater as originating from leaking nearby sewers. We have further shown that this approach can be predictive of groundwater contamination. The goal of this current research is to determine if a similar GIS-based modeling approach of sanitary sewer pipe exfiltration probabilities can be adapted for predicting where storm drains might be contaminated by human fecal material entering MS4s from nearby leaking sewers. Through modeling of municipal sanitary sewer and MS4 infrastructure this project identifies storm drains for field sampling. Up to twelve samples will be analyzed for fecal indicator bacteria DNA-based markers of human waste and potentially chemical markers. The broader goal of understanding which storm drains may be impacted by human fecal contamination would be addressed thus enabling the City to employ their management approaches to remedy contamination. The overall and long-term goal of this research is to improve microbiological water quality and public health at urban beaches. In conducting this research transferable knowledge and approaches are to be generated and disseminated via the published literature thus contributing to the general body of knowledge in environmental management of microbiological water quality. ,2016,2018

The restoration project includes restoring more than 135 acres of diverse habitats including a tidal connection to Devereux Slough intermittently flooded mudflats plover breeding habitat salt marsh and a variety of upland and freshwater habitats including vernal pools freshwater marsh native grassland coastal sage scrub and back dune swale woodland habitat. The project also includes excavation and placement of approximately 350000 cubic yards of fill on the former borrow site on South Parcel which is within the NCOS project area. The project includes a trail system with bridges and boardwalks that supports safe routes to school and a diversity of users with a variety of trail sizes and functions. The trail design was developed through a community based planning process in 2013-14 that included 4 public meetings and an opportunity to vote on alternatives in person and on-line. ,2017,2019

For hydrological connectivity small sections of surrounding states will also be modeled. For those major tributaries that are not yet modeled (e.g. HUC 0502 Monongahela) and that drain into this section of the Ohio River we will use the ORSANCO monitoring data as a placeholder for the flows and loads from these watersheds. This proposed project will benefit from our existing efforts funded by USEPA since we have already established the connections with Ohio EPA and ORSANCO to obtain the needed point source and observed water quality information. Implementing the model involves obtaining a number of datasets such as topography (digital elevation model) hydrologic network and observed hydrology from USGS; landuse data from the 2001 National Land Cover Dataset supplemented with the 2008 Cropland Survey for Ohio from USDA; point source and water quality observations data from Ohio EPA; ORSANCO monitoring data. The TWG project has allowed us to develop a number of software tools and algorithms for processing these large datasets to more rapidly implement each new watershed. If we did not have these tools the cost of implementing the model for these three HUCs (0503 0508 and 0509) would be approximately twice the proposed budget given the large area considered. The watersheds will be modeled at the 10-digit HUC level as shown in Figure 2. For practical purposes the models are implemented as distinct subwatersheds that can be run independently or together in a master project. Thus if someone needs to run a scenario for a small section within a watershed it is not necessary to run the entire master model. Data set collection and incorporation into the model will take approximately 3 months. Once the model is implemented and calibrated the model will be used to develop the trading coefficients for the entire state of Ohio. This involves evaluating the effect of a load reduction in a given location and its impact on the rest of the downstream watersheds. A matrix of the trading coefficients will be generated for use in the broader WQT program. The matrix will also be displayed graphically using ArcView or any other accepted Geographical Information System software. A number (approx. 20) of tradingscenarios within Ohio will be evaluated to illustrate the use of the model for WQT. The final report will detail the model implementation calibration analysis of the WQT scenarios and an explanation of the trading coefficient matrix. A proposed water quality monitoring program in support of the WQT program for the state of Ohio will also be included in the final report. ,2011,2016

Microbial source tracking assays have been developed that are highly sensitive and specific and this is a great advancement in tracking sources of microbial pollution in recreational waters. Our team has evaluated modern assays for their specificity and sensitivity and has applied well-performing assays to identifying sources contributing to regional microbiological water pollution. However interpreting assay results likely depends on the source of pollution when it was released and how it changed or aged within the environment. The relative abundances of assay markers are expected to change significantly during pollution source aging in the environment but the magnitude of those changes and the factors that contribute are unknown. This makes interpreting assay results from environmental samples very difficult. The overall goal of this project is to determine aging characteristics and contributing factors in the field and in the lab. ,2014,2016

This is particularly important when considering projects that are expected to produce environmental benefits across multiple resource categories and spatiotemporal scales. Hence a project have been conceived by the Tahoe Scientific Advisory Council that will contribute information and tools relevant to objectively evaluating landscape-scale projects purporting to provide multiple benefits in a changing environment. This project will initiate the assembly of the structural elements necessary to develop a decision support framework for the largest watershed in the Tahoe Basin. The project will: 1) provide a decision support framework for objectively evaluating the benefits of multi-resource projects and 2) provide tools for the identification of meaningful metrics for monitoring. The Council convened a workshop of scientists and agency representatives to review and document the scope of environmental and management components relevant to the Upper Truckee River (UTR) watershed (Figure 1). This information will be used to describe important drivers linkages and outcomes (D-L-O) of environmental processes and management actions within a set of linked or nested conceptual models. The conceptual models will include written narratives references and performance characteristics along with graphical representation of the system components that together communicate the D-L-O characteristics to a broad stakeholder audience. Draft conceptual models will be presented to the Upper Truckee River Watershed Advisory Group (UTRWAG) for review and input. This feedback will be incorporated and used to refine selected sub-models of identified importance and to identify a draft set of indicator metrics. The conceptual models and indicator metrics will be integrated into a decision support framework following the approach of DiGennero and others (San Francisco Estuary and Watershed Science 2012 v10). The utility and efficacy of the resulting DSF will be tested using a sample set of potential UTR watershed projects selected by UTRWAG from the existing Environmental Improvement Program project list. The approach and tools will be provided to UTRWAG for further evaluation and feedback. These tools results and the lessons learned will be documented along with the final conceptual models and sub-models. ,2018,2019

The prevailing paradigm for river restoration within central California and specifically within the California Bay-Delta Restoration Program is that establishment of a naturalized self-regulating alluvial river channel connected to its floodplain will produce a cascade of benefits through the re- establishment of spawning and rearing conditions initially for salmon and coincidentally for the successful development of a number of other native aquatic riparian and floodplain organisms. Based upon decades of study by the community of aquatic ecologists and river restoration professionals in California summarized in both the scientific literature and in various resource assessments and baseline survey reports [e.g. Stillwater Sciences 2001 2002; Trush et al. 2000] it has been proposed that a self-regulating alluvial river supporting a diversity and abundance of native species including salmonids has the following components: Unconstrained banks that allow the river channel to migrate laterally to create maintain and rejuvenate pools (rearing habitat) point bars (shallow margin rearing habitat) riffles (spawning habitat) and floodplains (riparian and terrestrial habitat). A gravel-bottomed river that is mobilized and redeposited frequently enough to destroy create and maintain sufficient spawning and rearing habitat. Temporal patterns of flow conditions sediment loads water quality and water temperatures that favor the long-term survival of numerous native species whose life cycles are adjusted to these variations. This conceptual framework constitutes the richest and most thoroughly elaborated paradigm available to river restoration professionals for re-establishing the linkages between what was formerly a dynamic physical environment and the biogeochemical and biological processes that yielded the biodiversity and productivity which are now diminished. However it is essentially a qualitative model conceptualized through comparative studies and informal observations in several rivers. We are not aware of any published quantitative study of the process linkages underlying this broad conceptual model. a fact that hinders its application to planning design and assessment of restoration projects. Now that some examples of the paradigm have been implemented it is possible to use them to: refine and elaborate some of the original design concepts answer questions about the desired biological responses by expanding studies of fish invertebrates and plants quantify the strengths of the hypothesized linkages between abiotic and biotic processes as the river systems evolve after restoration quantify how the reach-scale changes operate within the larger river systems in which they are nested. The project utilizes a ~5 km long reach of the Merced River as an outdoor natural-scale laboratory in which to observe model and test hypotheses about the linkages between geomorphic and hydrologic conditions and processes and the creation and maintenance of biological habitat.,2006,2013

A vegetation dynamics model BIOMOVE will be applied to a small set of indicator species to produce a database that supports the analysis of future vegetation conditions. BIOMOVE is a species-based model for assessing vegetation dynamics that are likely to result under future climate change scenarios. Using climate change data the model identifies the environmental conditions that could support an individual species under a future climate scenario and evaluates the likelihood of a species occupying the site given constraints from disturbance and competition. In particular the model simulates fire behavior as a constraint on dispersal. Each model run produces a GIS database that shows the future distribution of individual species. To support the 2010 Forest and Range Assessment Report being conducted by FRAP the project will be conducted to evaluate potential climate change impacts on forest vegetation. A small set of indicator species will be used to assess potential impacts from future climate change scenarios. The potential shifting and migration of these indicators species will be evaluated using the BIOMOVE model. The BIOMOVE model will be parameterized for two GCMs (global climate models) capturing the broadest range of climatic variability using the most recent IPCC climate forecast data for at least one future climate scenario.

A supply of gravel was stockpiled along the floodplain margin to support such management activity whenever it became desirable. In the approximately ten years since project construction the project reach has undergone some bed topographic changes (growth of point bars and the deepening of pools undercutting and migration of some river banks excavation of shallow depressions across the floodplain) changes in the grain size of bed material and the partial colonization of the floodplain by various types of plants. Habitat values are gradually evolving as a result of these changes. The flow regime that has caused channel changes during the post-construction decade has been dominated by several managed releases from the New Exchequer Dam. Most of the changes in channel morphology and grain size occurred in three overbank flows (2005 2006 and 2011) that extended entirely across the floodplain and lasted for several weeks each. These changes involved the development of point bars and the related shifting of maximum scour locations. Peak discharges ranged up to the equivalent of a 5-year flood in the regulated flow regime but the duration of these flow releases produced more sediment transport and channel change than would have been expected in three natural shorter floods. Bankfull and smaller flows did not transport significant volumes of sediment although some local changes of bed elevation occurred in the first year after construction while the bed was still in a loosely packed state. After ten years of project functioning it is appropriate to assess the nature of changes that have occurred in the form and functioning of the project site as they relate to channel stability and habitat values. There is also a need to better understand the extent to which adding gravel might alter rates of bar building bank migration and enhancement of salmon habitat in the reach. In particular it is possible to estimate what might be accomplished through gravel augmentation using the stockpiled gravel resource which has a particular volume and grain-size composition or with a modified gravel resource. The investigation will deliver: (i) A summary and assessment of channel changes during the first ten years of project operation (ii) A set of computer simulations of the effects on channel morphology and migration bed texture and the flow-field characteristics of salmon habitat to be expected from gravel augmentation under a range of conditions (augmentation rate grain- size composition and flow regime),2013,2013

Current models of species responses to climate change are generally at scales of 5-100 km and use climate projections with single windows of 50-80 years which is a very coarse resolution relative to the generation times and processes of plants and animals. Therefore moving down in spatial scale and incorporating multiple time steps opens many productive research pathways for collaboration between climatologists and biologists. Refining spatial and temporal scale comes with a series of challenges. Computational time increases exponentially rather than linearly with dimensions of scale. Stochastic processes become much more important as well leading to multiple outcomes as the model uncertainty increases. This research program will apply the BioMove model and other tools to climate change assessment at biologically relevant scales. It will pioneer new methods of working at fine scale as well as test the established model BioMove in these applications. Products of this research will include an analysis that will identify optimal networks of sites important for the conservation of species through multiple time-steps as climate changes in California. The project will also improve fire modeling develop a better understanding of vegetation regeneration and fire interactions at fine scale develop methods at annual temporal scales and create solutions for temporal spatial and computation problems.,2009,2012

Utility scale solar projects having less implementation track record than wind have potential impacts that are garnering increasing attention: habitat loss; alteration of water sources; elimination of crucial seasonal habitats; habitat fragmentation; disruption of movement patterns and connectivity and loss of gene flow; avoidance of project areas due to noise or human activity; invasive species that take advantage of disturbed sites; wildlife mortality on service roads; collisions or electrocutions from new transmission lines; or increasing predation as a result of additional prey perches on powerline poles (Western Governors‚Äô Association [WGA] 2008). Improvement in understanding is needed both about habitat-related effects and about cumulative impacts. By modeling the cumulative impacts from renewable energy development climate change and urban growth in the Western Mojave region Bare et al. (2009) were able to show where connectivity for desert tortoise and desert bighorn sheep would likely decrease. Avoidance behavior by wildlife of energy projects can lead to high energy costs to individuals from the cumulative effect when multiple projects occur along a species movement corridor (Fox et al. 2006). Each species however has different sensitivities to these habitat alterations. Adding to the uncertainty about specific impacts is the diversity of solar technologies. Some systems require high power towers at the center of the farm of heliostats. Tracking systems require greater spacing between rows of panels to avoid artificial shading. Habitat models that operate on the scale of these impacts have been missing but are now possible with recent advances in modeling. NEPA prescribes a mitigation hierarchy: avoid minimize restore or offset in descending order of preference. The bustle of planning activity for renewable energy in the West has focused on avoiding crucial habitats and minimizing impact on significant biological resources. The WGA has been assessing energy potential and wildlife impacts for several years. They established a process of selecting renewable energy zones (REZs). Sites of sufficient energy density were screened for statutory or regulatory limitations (e.g. designated wilderness areas) or general environmental or land use constraints. To rank these sites to inform the process of establishing REZs the Western Governors‚Äô Wildlife Council defined categories of High Sensitive Areas that are irreplaceable for wildlife Sensitive Areas where development would likely pose a significant risk to wildlife and Areas with Insufficient Data. NatureServe (2009) was contracted to map these sensitivity classes according to data and classification rules chosen by each state.,2011,2013
50p,Roland Geyer David Stoms,3/1/13,5/31/14,49898,California Energy Commision,"California state, municipal agencies",20111479,Potential Rooftop Photovoltaic Electricity for Sustainable Transportation in California,Community sustainability is determined in part by meeting transportation needs with locally- produced low-carbon energy. We recently demonstrated that supplying biomass feedstock from crops in California would require vast commitments of land with mixed impacts on wildlife species and loss of food-producing land (Stoms et al. 2011). We also showed that using photovoltaics (PV) to directly convert solar radiation into electricity for electric vehicles would have dramatically lower direct land requirements than biomass-based pathways based on corn or switchgrass (Geyer et al. 2011). Even the most efficient biomass- based pathway in the US counties with the highest potential crop yields requires 29 times more land than the PV-based alternative in the same location. Using average US insolation all gasoline consumed in US transportation in 2009 could be replaced with 1.1 million hectares of cadmium telluride PV systems without competing with food for fertile land (Geyer et al. 2011). PV-based sun-to-wheels transportation is particularly attractive for California since it harnesses the state‚Äôs excellent solar resources while requiring virtually no water or other resources during operation. It has the potential to be a key element for sustainable communities since PV systems can be installed on rooftops and in brownfields. What is unknown is whether there is sufficient area of rooftops available to meet California‚Äôs potential electric fuel demand. Solar electric transportation is amenable to distributed generation. Separate research studies on the three primary components of solar electric transportation‚Äîsolar insolation rooftop area per household available for PV installation and driving patterns‚Äîhas shown that all three vary with the location or socioeconomic characteristics of the communities. In this study we propose to integrate these three separate themes to assess the potential capacity of distributed rooftop PV systems to meet community-scale demand for personal vehicle transportation across California. Solar insolation has been modeled and shows strong gradients with latitude and average cloud cover. Rooftop area has been shown to be related to housing density. We will use Census2000 housing data at the block group level to model rooftop area. Rooftop area will be adjusted with empirical data from a previous CEC-funded study to account for shading building orientation or protuberances such as chimneys and vents (Navigant Consulting Inc. 2007). Driving patterns in terms of vehicle miles traveled (VMT) are also related to housing density (Brownstone and Golob 2009). We will apply our model of land area of PV per VMT for electric vehicles as a function of insolation (Geyer et al. 2011) to calculate the total surface area needed for PV panels to meet demand for solar transportation energy in a community. We will then determine the proportion of driving demand that could be supplied with PV systems across the state under the Renewable Portfolio Standard scenarios of adoption rates for electric vehicles. Total and available rooftop area will be validated with site-specific data where available (e.g. CH2M Hill solar maps). We will also estimate solar fuel cost per VMT based on industry figures for installed cost of PV for comparison with fossil fuel prices to determine how competitive PV is in individual communities. The geospatial results will be disseminated on a web map server where California ratepayers and sustainability planners will be able to see the overall potential for sun-to-wheels transportation in their communities. Electric vehicles distributors and solar PV installation firms can use this information to target communities with the greatest potential.,2013,2014

Our collaborators at UC Berkeley (Max Moritz and postdoc) will evaluate cover changes (trees to shrubs) and their consequences in Sierran watersheds while the UCSB group will focus on southern California coastal mountain ranges and eco-hydrological modeling. At UCSB we will use a combination of historic aerial photos GIS and fire occurrence records to evaluate factors contributing to watershed conversion in order to project areas vulnerable to future change. To study the consequences of land cover change we will select relatively fine-scale study areas to be compared stratified according to those that are dominated by native species and those that have largely been ‚Äútype converted‚Äù into non-native invasive species. Local scale measurements of water infiltration vegetation evapotranspiration and soil surface conditions will be used to parameterize watershed scale models to predict changes in water yield and nitrate run-off relative to vegetation condition. Small scale measurements will be used to parameterize and test the ecosystem watershed model RhesSys to evaluate the potential for largescale changes in water yield due to land cover change. RhesSys models will be developed for both the Sierran watersheds and a southern California watershed.,2011,2015

However due to the current lack of regulation chemical content disclosure and consumer awareness most manufacturers have little incentive to replace chemicals-of-concern (COCs) with safer alternatives. Assembly Bill 1879 requires DTSC to develop the Safer Consumer Products Regulations that establish a process to identify products that pose high risk to humans and the environment. Once identified the regulations require manufacturers to evaluate safer alternatives to COCs in those products by following an AA protocol and considering the impacts of the COCs and alternative formulations from life cycle (LC) perspective. By integrating LC thinking into the AA manufacturers can avoid shifting environmental burdens and making environmentally unfavorable substitutions. California State regulations permit DTSC to compile a list of 1200 candidate COCs. The list of candidate chemicals can be found at http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/SCP/ChemList.cfm. DTSC must identify consumer products containing COC‚Äôs and compile guidance for AA. The regulations apply to any COC ‚Äì containing product sold distributed supplied or manufactured for sale in California. In March of 2014 DTSC issued a list of 3 high-priority products of concern. DTSC is researching other specific product/chemical combinations of interest. The newly established Chemical Life Cycle Network (ChemLCNet) project at the Bren School UCSB will be developing a toolkit to assist manufacturers governments and researchers to determine the life cycle environmental implications of existing and new chemicals. The toolkit will be instantiated as an open-access interactive web-based tool that implements a parametric life cycle assessment (LCA) model of chemicals production use and end of life.,2014,2015

It is anticipated that different factors will be relevant to each category of pollutants; therefore different approaches will need to be developed for each category of pollutants. The study will develop scientifically defensible methodology for the analysis of different pollutant groupings. This methodology will be validated with a case study for naturally occurring minerals and nutrients in the Malibu Creek Watershed. The methodology should take into consideration EPA Region 10 ºs Natural Conditions Workgroup Report on Principles to Consider When Reviewing and Using Natural Conditions Provisions (April 2005). In addition where it is determined that certain natural geologic or hydrogeologic conditions contribute to high levels of naturally occurring pollutant(s) the study will provide a general assessment of statewide implications where feasible and appropriate.,2012,2013

We will map erosional and depositional landforms from recent aerial LiDAR images and historical aerial photographs into a GIS and conduct field measurements and other analyses. Specific questions to address through development of a rapid sediment budget (Reid and Dunne 1996) for various time periods include: 1) what are the significant active geomorphic processes (e.g. gullies slides incision) that deliver sediment to channels? 2) how do current and/or historical landuse activities influence sediment delivery rates relative to pre-disturbance natural background rates? 3) have landuse activities caused significant changes in channel sediment storage and sediment supply in alluvial channel reaches and or significant changes in the rate of sediment supply to the lagoon? 4) what are the relationships between grain size distributions in channels and bed mobility pool filling and sediment supply rate? Addressing these questions will increase our knowledge about the effects of anthropogenic and climate disturbances on geomorphic processes at the scale of a small coastal California watershed.,2014,2015
55p,Jordan Clark,8/1/12,7/31/13,21109,City of Avalon,"California state, municipal agencies",SB130002,Linking coastal contamination to the local sewage system using a sulfer hexaflouride as deliberate tracer,As part of a larger study being conducted by Dr. Stanley Grant (UC Irvine) a deliberate tracer experiment will be initiated by the UCSB group using sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). The methodology to be used was developed by Dr. Jordan Clark at UCSB to investigate the movement (travel times) of artificially recharged water near spreading ponds. Dr. Clark‚Äôs group has conducted groundwater tracer experiments in numerous locations in southern California (Gamlin et al. 2001; Clark et al. 2004 2005; Avisar and Clark 2005; McDermott et al. 2008). His group has also used SF6 to investigate mine drainage contamination to Clear Lake (Schladow and Clark 2008) and dispersion in the Stockton Deep Water Shipping Channel (Schmieder et al. 2008). In all cases permission was asked for and granted to use SF6 as a tracer in California aquifers. During the initial phase of the proposed experiment tracer-rich water will be released into the sewer lines as a series of hourly slug additions over a tidal cycle. The tracer rich water will be created by equilibrating about 20 liters of water with pure SF6 in a closed container. I expect that the finally SF6 concentration to be more than 10% of the equilibrium value. During the second phase water samples will be collected at location along the beach in pre weighed 10 ml VacutainersTM and sent to UCSB for analysis. All SF6 samples will be analyzed using a headspace method similar to that described by Clark et al. (2004). The VacutainersTM will be partially filled (about 5 ml of water) in the field. At UCSB they will be weighed (to determine the sample size) and carefully filled with ultra-high purity nitrogen gas (so that the final head space pressure is equal to about 1 atmosphere). After a brief shaking to equilibrate the nitrogen gas with the water sample the headspace gas will be injected through a column of Mg(ClO4)2 (to remove water vapor) into a small sample loop of known volume (about 1 ml). Subsequently the gas in the sample loop will be flushed into a gas chromatograph equipped with an electron capture detector with ultra-high purity nitrogen carrier gas. SF6 will be separated from other gases with a molecular sieve 5a column held at room temperature. The detector response will be determined by running gas standards purchased from Scott-Marrin Inc. With this method error on duplicate measurements is typically better than ¬±10%. Laboratory experiments have shown that SF6 samples can be stored for at least 6 months without appreciable loss of SF6 in VacutainerTM. The detection limit of this method is about 0.1 pmol/L so we will be able to detect sewer water after a 100000:1 dilution even if some SF6 is lost due to water-air gas transfer. SF6 a non-toxic and non-reactive gas is an ideal tracer of groundwater flow. It has been shown in laboratory experiments and during a field experiment conducted near Phoenix AZ that in the absence of non-aqueous phases its movement is not retarded in porous media (Wilson and Mackay 1993 1996; Gamlin et al. 2001; Lee et al. 2008). It has been used as a tracer for mixing and gas exchange for decades in a number of settings including lakes rivers and the open ocean (e.g. Wanninkhof 1985 1987; Ledwell et al. 1986; Clark et al. 1996; Schladow and Clark 2008; Schmieder et al. 2008; MacInyre et al. 2009). More recently SF6 has been used successfully in groundwater studies in California (Orange LA and Ventura Counties) that traced the movement of artificially recharged water through groundwater systems (Gamlin et al. 2001; Clark et al. 2004 2005; Avisar and Clark 2005; McDermott et al. 2008) and mine pit water into Clear Lake (Schladow and Clark 2008). In all cases permission was requested and granted by the Department of Public Health to use SF6 as a tracer in these potable supply aquifers. There are a number of advantages of using SF6 as a tracer of artificial recharge. First SF6 is more economical than most other tracers (such as Br- and Rhodamine dye) and hence more water can be tagged decreasing the probability that the tracers will pass wells undetected. Second it does not change the density of the tagged water thus buoyancy effects do not complicate the interpretation of the experimental results (e.g. Istok and Humphrey 1995). Third SF6 does not degrade the quality of the water; it causes no known adverse health effects (Lester and Greenberg 1950). Forth because it is a gas SF6 can be removed from water easily by aeration. In fact any SF6 that is discharged in to the bay will be lost to the atmosphere within a few weeks.,2012,2013
56p,Patricia Holden,2/1/08,8/31/09,76193,City of Santa Barbara,"California state, municipal agencies",22659,DNA-Based Microbial Source Tracking in Laguna Channel Santa Barbara,The City of Santa Barbara has previously identified ozone disinfection at the outlet of Laguna Channel (near the existing pump station) as an appropriate project for reducing beach warnings. Prior to moving forward with such a project the City seeks to better understand the watershed for example in terms of inputs of polluted runoff vs. uncontaminated groundwater. Additional study may identify project(s) that provide more treatment per unit cost and/or have lower maintenance costs over the lifetime of the project. Prior Mission Creek study included some sampling in the lower Laguna watershed specifically in the Channel just upstream of Chase Palm Park and in the Laguna Lagoon. Results to date support that DNA-based markers of human fecal contamination can be found in the lower Laguna watershed. However sampling to date has been limited and the samples thus far demonstrate significant temporal variability. Before investments are made in treatment infrastructure or other remedial activities towards improving creek and coastal water quality in the Laguna Channel watershed area a more comprehensive study is needed at the watershed scale to define the spatial extent and temporal patterns of fecal contamination and sources. The project seeks to identify human contamination sources their temporal (diurnal and other) variability and potentially determining other host sources of fecal bacterial contamination in water samples collected for this study.,2008,2009
57p,Patricia Holden,3/1/10,2/28/11,15000,City of Santa Barbara,"California state, municipal agencies",383517,Canine Scent and Microbial Source Tracking in Santa Barbara CA,Advances in microbial source tracking have enabled communities to gain more information about the specific hosts that may be responsible for elevated indicator bacteria levels in recreational waters. However even when human-specific contamination can be traced to general areas finding exact origins remains challenging due to sample costs and processing times. This study sought to test the use of a new qualitative tool for source tracking canine scent tracking (sewage-sniffing dogs) to provide real-time results and low sample cost for illicit discharge detection. This research fulfilled a contract with the City of Santa Barbara (City) to evaluate canine scent tracking as a water quality tool for storm water managers and water quality researchers. The low cost rapid and real-time nature of canine-scent tracking‚Äîas a screening approach for sewage-contaminated waters‚Äîmake if an attractive and tractable tool for small communities. However while canine scent tracking is invaluable in criminal forensics its use in environmental forensics particularly with regards to its accuracy in revealing sewage in environmental waters has been unknown. The collaboration included Scott and Karen Reynolds of Environmental Canine Services LLC (ECS) along with their trained dogs Sable and Logan. The research mainly involved determining if sampling locations contaminated with sewage as previously determined by quantitative DNA-based microbial source tracking traditional indicator bacteria tests and chemical fingerprinting were indicated as contaminated by canine scent tracking. Another objective was to determine if canine scent tracking can be used to further locate or bracket sources of human waste in a storm drain network that have been confirmed by microbial source tracking. Canine responses were compared against traditional wastewater indicators illicit discharge detection tracers and emerging human-specific waste markers in storm drain locations in Santa Barbara CA. Canine scent tracking was also tested for effectiveness in locating contaminated inputs to storm drains addressing a specific hypothesis of contamination arising from illicit dumping from recreational vehicles and conducting systematic watershed reconnaissance. Based on the statistical and qualitative results presented in this pilot- scale study canine scent tracking is a tool that should be expanded for use by researchers and stormwater managers.,2010,2011
58p,Patricia Holden,10/14/08,3/31/11,340000,City of Santa Barbara,"California state, municipal agencies",22926,Microbial Source Tracking Protocol Development,Santa Barbara like many urbanized coastal communities in California frequently determines that fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) concentrations in surf zone water exceed State of California AB411 criteria. This project involved research in support of determining origins of FIB associated with human fecal pollution (sewage) in storm drains that discharge to coastal creeks flowing to Santa Barbara beaches. The overall goals were to determine origins of sewage contamination in storm drains during dry weather and to compile a protocol for other communities to use for similar source tracking purposes based on the results of this research. Research involved field work field sampling of water and fecal samples and laboratory analysis of field samples. Methods for alternative sewage indicators were researched and selected methods were recruited and tested for their utility in assessing sewage in storm drains. A novel approach was developed for studying exfiltration (sanitary to storm sewer) that involved dispensing rhodamine WT dye into sanitary sewers and detecting a fluorescence signal continuously in real time in storm drain manholes using a field-deployable battery-driven submersible optical probe with data logger. The specificity of two similar widely-used approaches for quantifying sewage contamination in water samples through quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis of DNA markers in human waste was tested. This involved collecting fecal samples from various non-target (raccoon gull rat dog cat) hosts and target (human septage sewage) materials then comparing the specificity of two popular qPCR- based approaches for quantifying human markers. Equipment items for flow measurement in storm drains and automated continuous sampling were researched and selected then deployed at two locations for 72 hour campaigns to better understand temporal variation in human waste contamination and in storm drain flow. A high-density microarray of DNA probes the PhyloChip was used to assess differences in fecal source bacterial communities for the non-target (as above) and human-associated (as above) fecal samples. The fecal source bacterial community profiles by PhyloChip were then compared to water sample bacterial communities for samples collected in various sites of interest based on historical FIB and/or human DNA-marker contamination. A GIS database was assembled with microbiological data‚Äîboth historical from recent studies conducted by UCSB for the City and also from this study‚Äîdisplayed along with storm drains sanitary sewers and streets with the latter three types of data already contained in the City GIS database as separate layers. The GIS database was used to generate several products for visualizing information and for planning remediation and research. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) were developed for all procedures and assays found to be most useful in tracking human waste in storm drains. A protocol for implementing these procedures was designed for others to use in similar studies. The conclusions of this study regard how communities based on our experiences in this research should best approach source tracking human waste in storm drains.,2008,2011
59p,Jordan Clark,5/21/08,4/30/09,28636,Inland Empire Utilities Agency,"California state, municipal agencies",,Chino Basin Tracer Study,The Chino Basin Tracer Study is intended to directly determine groundwater transit times from the Brooks spreading ponds to selected monitoring and production wells. It will be conducted in conjunction with the Inland Empire Utilities Agency (IEUA). The specific goals of this study are: I) Inject sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and enriched boric acid tracers and quantify their concentrations in the spreading pond over a period of three weeks. II) Travel times of the tracer will be determined by sampling groundwater at production and monitoring wells. The methodology to be used during the proposed tracer study is very simple and was developed by Dr. Jordan Clark at UCSB. It has been used previously in Orange County LA County and Ventura County (Gamlin et al. 2001; Clark et al. 2004 2005; Avisar and Clark 2005; McDermott et al. 2006). During the initial phase of the proposed project SF6 and 10B- enriched boric acid (as a borate solution) will be injected into the percolating surface water and groundwater samples will be collected at the three nearby monitoring wells (MW-A MW-H and BRK-1). During the second phase water samples will be collected at selected wells and analyzed for the tracer at UCSB so that travel times can be determined. The tracer injection will begin at least two week after the initiation of the artificial recharge. In addition to minimizing the loss of gas that may occur during the transit through the unsaturated zone the postponement of the start of the tracer experiment will allow gradients (and flow) typical of artificial recharge conditions to set up. The tracer will be injected into the spreading ponds by bubbling following the procedure developed for the El Rio (Ventura county) and Montebello Forebay (LA county) tracer experiments. Because it is vital to know the initial conditions of the recharge water SF6 and boron isotope surveys in the spreading basin will be conducted every 3 to 4 days during the injection. Each survey will consist of collecting about 10 samples evenly distributed throughout the spreading area. More than 50 SF6 samples will be analyzed during the initial phase of the proposed project. Only a sub-set (approximately 10) of the samples which will be determined based on the SF6 data will be analyzed for boron isotopes. The SF6 samples will be analyzed using the Wanninkhof et al. (1987) head space method modified by Clark et al (2004). In the field pre-weighed 10 ml VacutainerTM will be partially filled (about 7 ml of water). These containers will be sent to UCSB where they will be weighed (to determine the sample size) and carefully filled with ultra-high purity nitrogen gas (so that the final pressure is equal to 1 atmosphere). After 1 minute of shaking to equilibrate the nitrogen gas with the water sample the head space gas will be injected through a column of Mg(ClO4)2 (to remove water vapor) into a small sample loop of known volume (about 1 ml). Subsequently the gas in the sample loop will be flushed into a gas chromatograph equipped with an electron capture detector with ultra-high purity nitrogen carrier gas. SF6 will be separated from other gases with a molecular sieve 5a column held at room temperature. The detector response is determined by running gas standards purchased from Scott-Marrin Inc. Error on duplicate measurements is typically less than ¬±10%. Laboratory experiments have shown that SF6 samples can be stored for at least 6 months without appreciable lost of SF6 in VacutainerTM. The boron isotope ratios will be determined at UCSB on an ICP-MS following the procedure outlined by GaÃàbler and Bahr (1999). To minimize the background a teflon spray chamber and quartz injector will be utilized. The typical analytical uncertainty with this method is less than ¬±0.5%. The system will be calibrated using the National Bureau of Standards Reference Material NBS-951 for boron isotopes.,2008,2009

For hydrological connectivity small sections of surrounding states will also be modeled. For those major tributaries that are not yet modeled (e.g. HUC 0502 Monongahela) and that drain into this section of the Ohio River we will use the ORSANCO monitoring data as a placeholder for the flows and loads from these watersheds. This proposed project will benefit from our existing efforts funded by USEPA since we have already established the connections with Ohio EPA and ORSANCO to obtain the needed point source and observed water quality information. Implementing the model involves obtaining a number of datasets such as topography (digital elevation model) hydrologic network and observed hydrology from USGS; land use data from the 2001 National Land Cover Dataset supplemented with the 2008 Cropland Survey for Ohio from USDA; point source and water quality observations data from Ohio EPA; ORSANCO monitoring data.The TWG project has allowed us to develop a number of software tools and algorithms for processing these large datasets to more rapidly implement each new watershed. If we did not have these tools the cost of implementing the model for these three HUCs (0503 0508 and 0509) would be approximately twice the proposed budget given the large area considered. The watersheds will be modeled at the 10-digit HUC level as shown in Figure 2. For practical purposes the models are implemented as distinct subwatersheds that can be run independently or together in a master project. Thus if someone needs to run a scenario for a small section within a watershed it is not necessary to run the entire master model. Data set collection and incorporation into the model will take approximately 3 months. Once the model is implemented and calibrated the model will be used to develop the ‚Äútrading coefficients‚Äù for the entire state of Ohio. This involves evaluating the effect of a load reduction in a given location and its impact on the rest of the downstream watersheds. A matrix of the trading coefficients will be generated for use in the broader WQT program. The matrix will also be displayed graphically using ArcView or any other accepted Geographical Information System software. A number (approx. 20) of trading scenarios within Ohio will be evaluated to illustrate the use of the model for WQT. The final report will detail the model implementation calibration analysis of the WQT scenarios and an explanation of the trading coefficient matrix. A proposed water quality monitoring program in support of the WQT program for the state of Ohio will also be included in the final report.,2011,2016

At the shallow (~18 m water depth) OCSD 78” outflow discharge location, fresh (i.e. buoyant compared with ambient ocean saltwater) plume waters are expected to quickly rise to the ocean surface (top few meters). Drifters drogued at 1meter depth provide a direct measure of transport pathways taken by surface water parcels. Horizontal eddy diffusion values (i.e. mixing rates) are accurately obtained from the relative motion of drifters. CTD measurements following drifter motion give a direct measure of plume dilution as fresh plume waters mix with ambient saltwater. Primary goals of the study are: 1. Make repeated direct measurements of wastewater plume pathways from the diffuser location with water-following drifters. 2. Make repeated direct measurement of plume concentration (via salinity and CDOM) following plume (drifter) motion. 3. Quantify rates of horizontal plume mixing (dilution). 4.

The project aims to develop and implement source identification (ID) protocols to enhance the State of California Clean Beach Initiative grant applicants‚Äô ability to design and submit competitive implementation projects for Proposition 84 funding. The program includes (1) evaluating and selecting reliable DNA-based source ID protocols and (2) testing the methods to find bacterial sources at high priority beaches. The knowledge will be transferred to local agencies and an infrastructure will be created so that future source investigations can be carried out more consistently and successfully. In addition a source identification manual for AB538 (Assembly Bill 538) will be created and results will be disseminated.,2010,2014

Microbial source tracking assays have been developed that are highly sensitive and specific and this is a great advancement in tracking sources of microbial pollution in recreational waters. Our team has evaluated modern assays for their specificity and sensitivity and has applied well- performing assays to identifying sources contributing to regional microbiological water pollution. However interpreting assay results likely depends on the source of pollution when it was released and how it changed or ‚Äúaged‚Äù within the environment. The relative abundances of assay markers are expected to change significantly during pollution source aging in the environment but the magnitude of those changes and the factors that contribute are unknown. This makes interpreting assay results from environmental samples very difficult. The overall goal of this project is to determine aging characteristics and contributing factors in the field and in the lab.,2014,2016

Conservation benefits of marine reserves are well documented. The effects of MPA‚Äôs on fisheries remain hotly debated. The potential for MPA's at the Channel Islands and throughout CA to achieve the goals of the MLPA can be assessed only through monitoring of reserves. The primary technique used for reserve monitoring at the Channel Islands is visual SCUBA survey. This survey technique while essential and informative is inadequate for a number of important fishery species that are nocturnal cryptic and/or live at great depth (spiny lobster and some fishes). The use of traps is a more efficient sampling approach for these species especially when conducted collaboratively by biologists and commercial fishermen. An additional advantage of trap surveys is that they facilitate tag-recapture studies of growth stock size movement and fishery/MPA interactions. We have used traps successfully in preliminary collaborative monitoring studies in the Channel Islands. PISCO and NPS researchers using SCUBA surveys show great interest in partnering with us to improve overall monitoring of Channel Island and other MLPA reserves. This project will focus on conducting trap surveys to assess the performance of northern Channel Island MPAs for CA spiny lobster (Panulirus interruptus) cabezon (Scorpaenichthys marmoratus) CA sheephead (Semicossyphus pulcher) grass rockfish (Sebastes restrilleger) and other fishes targeted by California‚Äôs live-fish fishery.

The specific goals of this study are: I) Inject sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) tracer and quantify its concentrations in the spreading pond over a period of one week. SF6 a non-toxic and non-reactive gas is an ideal tracer of groundwater flow. It has been shown in laboratory experiments and during a field experiment conducted in Orange County CA that in the absence of non-aqueous phases its movement is not retarded in porous media (Wilson and Mackay 1993 1996; Gamlin et al. 2001). It has been used as a tracer for mixing and gas exchange for decades in a number of setting including lakes rivers and the open ocean (Wanninkhof 1985 1987; Ledwell et al. 1986; Clark et al. 1994 1996). More recently SF6 has been used successfully in about a half dozen groundwater studies in California (Orange LA and Ventura Counties) that traced the movement of artificially recharged water through groundwater systems (Gamlin et al. 2001; Fram et al. 2003; Clark et al. 2004 2005; Avisar and Clark 2005; McDermott et al. 2006).

For the restoration of streams and their watersheds successful implementation also requires clear recognition of the contextual framework in which the degradation is occurring so that tools and lessons learned from prior efforts can be applied but only where appropriate; and a realistic understanding of what restoration outcomes are feasible given both watershed context and preexisting social and economic constraints. Stream restoration is thus a complex and multi-dimensional enterprise and so there should be little surprise that examples of successful stream restoration are few. Practitioners typically embark on project analysis with a limited geographical and thematic scope thus inviting treatment of local symptoms of degradation rather than underlying causes; using a static body of knowledge without application of the most current scientific findings and engineering approaches; and bringing a narrow geographic range of practice which encourages the application of tools developed in one hydro-geo-eco-climatic region that may be completely inappropriate in another.

The goal of this project has been to support the overall EMRRP effort to enhance the capacity and capability of the national stream restoration community of public and private practitioners with an explicit focus on urban streams throughout the varied climatological and physiographic regions of the United States.

As the climate warms the timing and quantity of water from snow and glacial melt is changing. Little is known about the spatial distribution of snow over vast areas of the world. A few areas have relatively dense measurement networks or aerial snow surveys that provide estimates of basin wide snow water equivalent (SWE) which greatly aid runoff forecasts. Most mountain areas i.e. almost all of High Mountain Asia lack such measurements and therefore have nonexistent or poor runoff forecasts. Additionally there is no baseline in these areas as accurate snow measurements are not available retrospectively either. In these austere areas estimates of snow on the ground must be derived from different satellite measurements all of which suffer from limitations. We have developed a snowmelt energy balance model called the Parallel Energy Balance Model (ParBal) that is driven entirely by satellite-based measurements. ParBal is highly parallelized and optimized so that it can be run at resolutions that are an order of magnitude greater than current operational products as well as for large areas (continents) over long time periods (decades). Recently ParBal was used to build a snowpack in reverse with a technique called SWE Reconstruction. The reconstructed SWE was then validated using snow measurements from an aerial laser scanner and spectrometer in the Tuolumne Basin CA. Results show that ParBal performed better than any other method tested with no bias and very low (26%) mean absolute error (MAE) for basin-wide SWE. In contrast the operational model used by the National Weather Service The Snow Data Assimilation System overestimated SWE in every year with a 33% mean Bias and a 65% MAE. SWE Reconstruction has several limitations: it is only available retrospectively after the snow melts; it can only estimate ablation; and it is only valid for regions with little accumulation during ablation. Because of these limitations we will use reconstructed SWE as training data in machine learning techniques. We will use snow measurements that are available daily from optical- and micro-wavelength sensors aboard satellites as predictors. Machine learning allows for flexible utilization of these predictors since it is known that certain sensors are more effective in certain geographic areas and during certain times of the year. In this manner we will generate models that can be used for near real-time SWE prediction with the lags (i.e. a day or two) coming only from processing time. ,2016,2018
73p,Jeff Dozier Ned Bair,1/20/15,1/19/20,150215,DA Army Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory,Federal agencies,W913E5-15-C-0003,Methods to Estimate and Validate the Spatial Distribution of Snow Water Equivalent (SWE),Accurate estimates of snow water equivalent (SWE) in mountain watersheds pose a longstanding unsolved problem. Operational models high uncertainty imposes costs for water users. For instance April to July runoff forecasts for the American River in Californias Sierra Nevada have a median error of 18% and sometimes exceed 100% [Dozier 2011]. Uncertainty stems from the heterogeneous nature of mountain snow. Spectral mixing techniques using satellite-based imagery in the visible and near-infrared bands have been successful at mapping snow covered area (SCA) at sub-pixel resolution [e.g. Rosenthal and Dozier 1996; Painter et al. 2009]. The remotely sensed date of disappearance of snow from each pixel can be combined with a calculation of melt to reconstruct the accumulated SWE for each day back to the last significant snowfall [Martinec and Rango 1981]. Successful examples of reconstructed SWE include large basins in the Rocky Mountains [Molotch 2009] and the Sierra Nevada [Rittger 2012; Guan et al. 2013; Girotto et al. 2014]. Reconstructions main advantage lies in its provision of spatially resolved SWE estimates without the need for ground based observations but its biggest disadvantage is that SWE can only be calculated retroactively after snow disappears. Alternatively passive microwave (PM) sensors offer real-time global SWE estimates but suffer from several issues notably signal loss in wet snow [Chang 2000] saturation in deep snow [Kelly et al. 2003; Takala et al. 2011; Hancock et al. 2013] decreasing SWE with increasing forest fraction [Nolin 2010; Tedesco and Narvekar 2010] subpixel variability in the mountains owing to the large (~25 km) pixel size [Vander Jagt et al. 2013] and SWE overestimation in the presence of large grains such as depth and surface hoar [Derksen et al. 2005; Durand et al. 2011]. Overarching goal: The proposed research uses reconstruction to validate and improve real- time passive microwave estimates of SWE as well as validating reconstruction itself.,2015,2020

75p,J. Carter Ohlmann,12/1/08,3/31/12,146651,Jet Propulsion Laboratory,Federal agencies,1360271,Impact of NASA Satellite Data and Models on U.S. Coast Guard's Decision Support Tool for Search and Rescue in the Northeastern Pacific Ocean,"A drifter study is being proposed for a quantitative indication of horizontal advection and diffusion processes in the study region over a wide range of time and space scales. Drifters provide a direct measure of transport pathways taken by surface water parcels. In addition, dispersion values are accurately obtained from drifter data by considering the relative motion of drifter pairs. Finally, drifter data can quantify sub-grid-scale motions averaged in H.F. radar fields, and provide a means for quantifying trajectories determined from both Eulerian data (i.e. H.F. radar) and numerical models. The primary goals of the proposed drifter work are: ● observe the eddy energy on scales not resolved by HF radar ● validate HF radar derived velocities ● quantify the skill of trajectories determined from numerical models Data from a set of drifting buoys, or drifters, will be collected and used to achieve the project goals. A total of 12 drifters will be repetitively deployed in a variety of configurations so as to achieve the project goals during the ~2 week intensive sampling program. The first sampling configuration (hereafter “small scale deployment”) will involve placing all 12 drifters uniformly within a 1x1 km HF radar grid cell. As the drifters leave the box, they will be retrieved and redeployed so as to maintain a nearly uniform distribution throughout the box. This sampling configuration will give in situ time and space average surface current values over the same scales as observed with HF radar, thus allowing for validation HF radar data and quantification of the eddy kinetic energy (EKE) that exists on sub HF radar scales (i.e. Ohlmann et al 2007). 149 Knowledge of the quality of HF radar data and the aliased energy are crucial parameters that must accompany assimilation of HF radar data in numerical models. The second sampling configuration (hereafter “large scale deployment”) will involve successive deployment of clusters of 3 drifters throughout a day. The drifters will be left to sample the circulation for roughly 3 days, or until it appears they are near beaching or exiting the sound. This sampling configuration will give in situ trajectories that can be used for quantifying skill of trajectories obtained from numerical model results. In addition, the data will give examples of how trajectories can change with small variations in the deployment time. Finally, computation of eddy diffusivity values on a number of scales from drifter pair separation statistics will provide direct observations of eddy motions that are parameterized in numerical models. Small scale deployments will occur within an HF radar grid cell located where radials are near orthogonal so as to avoid errors from geometric dilution of precision. This sampling configuration will be carried out for 1 day at the beginning, middle, and end of the observational period. Drifters will be drogued at a depth of 1 meter, close to integration depth of the radar which depends on HF radar operating frequency. Large scale deployments will occur during the first and second weeks of the intensive observational period so as to (presumably) capture flows during two unique synoptic events. Drogue depth, primarily at 1 meter, will be altered on one of the cluster releases to look at variation in the effect of wind drift with depth. This will be especially useful for model validation which assimilates surface data and predicts subsurface values. A recent study shows the significance of vertical shear in the horizontal current field over the top few meters of the ocean on determination of trajectories (French McCay et al. 2007) High resolution Microstar drifters are proposed. The recently developed Microstar (Ohlmann et al. 2005) records its position with GPS and transmits the position data to a host computer using the Iridium satellite communications network. Data transmission is near real-time allowing drifter positions to be monitored from any computer with internet access. Position data, sampled every 10 minutes, is accurate to within ~10 m. The sampling frequency provides a high signal-to- noise ratio even in small velocity regimes. The spatial accuracy and near real-time transmission enables drifters to be recovered and redeployed. The Microstar uses a collapsible scaled-down tri-star type drogue with a drag-area-ratio greater than 41 that is centered at ~1 m depth. Slip is ~0.1% of the wind speed (~1 cm/s in 10 m/s of wind) which is typical of modern-day drifters. The Microstar is appropriate for the proposed work for a number of reasons. First, it has extremely high spatial and temporal resolution, required to resolve the small scales of motion that characterize coastal flows.",2008,2012

Himalayan glacier retreat is commonly attributed to global warming but air temperature and black carbon (BC) only began to increase appreciably about 40 years ago [Kaspari et al. 2011] whereas widespread increases in dust loading to the Himalaya in the last 150 years [Thompson et al. 2000; Conroy et al. 2013] have coincided with the sustained glacier retreat in the Himalaya. Recent in situ measurements ice cores and modeling of aerosol transport and radiative forcing in the Himalaya suggest that snow darkening earlier exposure of darker glacier ice owing to more rapid snowmelt and atmospheric heating from dust and BC may have at-surface radiative forcings 1 to 2 orders of magnitude stronger than those from all greenhouse gases [Qian et a. 2011; Nair et al. 2013; Kaspari et a/ 2014]. This evidence leads us to understand that a complex mix of forcings is changing this iconic region beyond just radiative forcing from greenhouse gases. To explore this complex mix we work under an overarching science goal: quantitatively understand physical processes that drive changes in the snow and ice of High Mountain Asia. ,2017,2019

Except for the light-use efficiency factor all variables used in the algorithm can be obtained from remotely sensed data (benthic community incident light community absorption). Approaches to derive these variables will be tested in collaboration with colleagues working on the atmospheric and optics components of the project. The calcification product cannot be derived directly from measurements made above a reef and thus will be based on the documented relationships between productivity and calcification for various organisms or communities.

Building on experiences gained through participation in the SIMBIOS project we will merge individual mission determinations of daily level-3 water-leaving radiance in a semi-analytical model and produce a suite of unified ocean color data products. This approach takes advantage of spectral information provided by each satellite sensor and simultaneously produces three distinct science products (chlorophyll and coefficients for colored detrital material absorption and particulate backscatter). This will also account for uncertainty in the input mission data as well as producing uncertainty indices for the merged data products. The data products generated by the merging procedure will be validated against in situ data and by comparisons with single mission products. Science applications of the merged products will also serve to validate these new merged products and to demonstrate their utility. All aspects of model development data sets comparison and validation will be documented and available to NASA/GSFC for implementation and the production of merged products for the complete EOS/NPP era. UCSB will interact and work with the GSFC group on merged products comparisons and the identification and fixing of incompatibilities between merged products from different approaches.

The structure of kelp lends itself to aerial mapping; however, very few recent studies have used satellite mapping to calculate kelp coverage and none have done this with high spatial and temporal resolution. Through a partnership with Terra Image USA, UC Santa Barbara has the unique opportunity to access multiple dates of imagery of the Santa Barbara Channel from May of 2004 to the present. Using this imagery, we can create maps of kelp canopy coverage on a monthly basis and use them to understand the forcing of the kelp ecosystem by oceanographic and biotic processes on various spatial and temporal scales. We will parameterize predictive statistical and demographic models of kelp dynamics to predict changes in regional populations resulting from environmental forcing such as long term climate change.

UVR photolysis of CDOM drives the global ocean surface distribution of CDOM seen from satellite. Light absorption by CDOM dominates UVR flux in the upper ocean, moderating photobiological processes and photochemistry of trace gases. Characteristics of CDOM relating to light exposure are observed in the ocean interior, and a quantitative understanding of photolysis will advance the potential utility of CDOM as a remotely- sensed ocean tracer. I propose experimental determinations of apparent quantum yield of CDOM photolysis on open-ocean samples and immediate application of these measurements to global CDOM data derived from NASA ocean color. Through this method, rates of photolytic loss, net production by bioremineralization, and seasonal entrainment of CDOM will be quantified such that an annual mixed layer budget for open-ocean CDOM is established.",2006,2009

However, the prospects are much more deficient: currently existing satellite systems do not offer methods to estimate snow water equivalence (density depth) or snow wetness over the range of Earth’s environments. The proposed study will identify the suitable microwave sensor parameters and develop the corresponding quantitative retrieval algorithms for monitoring spatial and temporal distributions of snow water equivalence and snow wetness of the seasonal snow cover on land. The components of this investigation are: (1) completion of the database simulation for the algorithm development under the sensor configurations identified by NASA Cold Land Processes Working Group; (2) development of a physically-based algorithm to estimate snow water equivalence from dual-frequency and dual-polarization radar measurements; (3) development of a physically-based algorithm to estimate snow wetness with dual- frequency radar measurements; (4) development of a combined (active/passive) physically-based algorithm to estimate snow water equivalence using dual-polarization Ku-band radar and dual-frequency radiometer measurements. We will use a state-of-the-art, physically-based microwave model to generate a simulated backscatter and emissivity database that covers a variety of the most possible snow and underlying ground properties for different sensor parameters (frequency and polarization). These data will be used to evaluate and characterize of the frequency and polarization dependences of each scattering and emission component. Quantitative retrieval algorithms under the various sensor configurations will be developed by either iterative, physical, or statistical techniques. We will validate our algorithms using CLPX’02, CLPX’03, and future CLPX experiments as well as other available ground scatterometer and radiometer measurements. We will engage the CLPX data set to examine the robustness of these retrieval techniques of a variety of topographic and land cover conditions.",2006,2009

Kelp forests have great economic value and are harvested for use in products ranging from pharmaceuticals and cosmetics to food products and aquaculture feed. Perhaps more importantly, giant kelp is an “ecosystem engineer” providing both food and habitat to a diverse array of biologically and commercially important species of algae, invertebrates, fish, and marine mammals while exporting large quantities of organic matter to adjacent littoral and continental shelf ecosystems. Economic analyses show California kelp forests create at least $250 million in revenue each year. Here, we propose to develop a predictive understanding of giant kelp forests in the nearshore waters of California using a combination of remote sensing, numerical modeling and the analysis of available field data. We will take advantage of high resolution, multi-spectral SPOT imagery to map kelp cover dynamics on spatial scales of >10 m and monthly time scales. We will develop new measures of kelp productivity and kelp canopy condition that can be assayed using available remote sensing imagery as well as to guide future mission planning. We will examine the role of disturbance and other environmental factors such as surface wave stress (using regional wave models), coastal currents (using HF radar remote sensing), sediment plumes (using MODIS & SeaWiFS ocean color imagery) and nutrient availability (using field and remote sensing proxies) on our high resolution observations of kelp canopy cover. Our goal is to use these data to develop a predictive understanding of kelp forest metapopulation dynamics (e.g., persistence, colonization, disturbance, etc.) that can be applied to the California coast.

Day-to-day supervision of the technician is done by the BATS program. The BBOP technician, selected and trained by Dr. N.

Environmentalists, politicians and scientists are coming to an agreement that marine resources need to be managed more effectively. Much of this crisis has come from our inadequacy to forecast the future state of marine ecosystems and fish biomass. This has led to the adoption of ecosystem-based management (EBM) methods (White et al, 2008, Botsford et al, 2003, Halpern & Warner, 2002). The work that I am proposing will improve our ability to predict a fundamental aspect of EBM: larval connectivity (Kinlan & Gaines, 2003). For many important, nearshore, fished stocks population connectivity, mediated by larval dispersal, is a fundamental driving force behind population dynamics. My work aims to predict larval connectivity. I will develop an inter- disciplinary model that integrates numerical ocean simulations with NASA data products. This model will focus, in a spatially explicit manner, on the two dominant forms of larval mortality: • Abiotic mortality due to advection, by ocean currents, away from suitable habitat. • In-flight biotic mortality, due to predation and starvation, along the larval dispersal trajectory. By considering both the abiotic and biotic forms of larval mortality my work will describe larval connectivity in unprecedented detail. I propose to: • Develop simulations of larval dispersal, using the results of existing high resolution hydrodynamic simulations of the waters off Southern California. This will generate estimates of abiotic larval mortality. • Use satellite sea-surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll (Chl) data products to quantify the in-flight nutritional experience of dispersing larvae. • Investigate the relationship between in-flight larval mortality and SST and Chl experience. I will do this for a number of exemplar species whose life history describe a range of survival abilities. • Use an existing stock-harvest model to explore the economic consequences of abiotic and in- flight biotic mortality. This work will take the Southern California Bight (SoCal Bight) as a test bed. We will develop Lagrangian particle advection simulations of larval dispersal, representing the cutting edge in our ability to predict patterns of larvae dispersal, and by integrating information generated from several NASA assets (Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor/SeaWiFS, MODIS/AQUA and the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer/AVHRR), we will, for the first time, generate estimates of both the abiotic loss of larvae and the in-flight biotic loss of larvae.

Each PnB cruise is made up of seven oceanographic stations (Figure 1), all taken on one day. At each station, a variety of optical, physical, biological, chemical and geological oceanographic parameters are 173 sampled (Table 1). All sampling protocols and analysis methods have been consistently applied and are consistent with those recommended by the SeaWiFS, SIMBIOS and JGOFS programs (e.g., Knap et al. 1993; Mueller and Austin, 1995; Fargion and Mueller, 2000). Documentation for PnB field procedures is available at www.icess.ucsb.edu/PnB/MethodsManual.html. Determinations of water leaving radiance spectra LwN(l) are the key ingredient in any ocean color field effort. Estimates of LwN(l) will be determined by analysis of spectroradiometry profiles (a BSI PRR-2600 system). We have published an intercomparison analysis using PnB data which indicates that determinations of LwN(l) are best made using determinations of the upwelling radiance leaving the ocean and measurements of incident irradiance (Toole et al. 2000). In addition, vertical profiles of diffuse attenuation coefficient spectra, Kd(z,l), are measured. All radiometric measurements are calibrated at UCSB against NIST traceable standards (O’Brien et al. 2000). The UCSB facility has participated in all SIRREX and SIMBIOS calibration studies (O’Brien et al. 2000; simbios.gsfc.nasa.gov/RoundRobin/). At each station, discrete water samples will be collected for surface waters using our SeaBird CTD/rosette sampler (12 5-liter Niskin bottles). Analyses will be made for chlorophyll a (Turner fluorometry), inorganic nutrient (SiO4, NO3, NO2 & PO4; UCSB analytical lab), particulate organic material (POC & PON; UCSB analytical lab), dissolved organic material (DOC & DON; Craig Carlson’s lab - UCSB) and lithogenic and biogenic particulate silica (Mark Brzezinski’s lab - UCSB) concentrations. The POC/PON and DOC/DON sampling is new for PnB and we started collected samples for analysis in January of this year. Samples will also be taken for phytoplankton pigment concentrations. Spectrophotometric analysis of absorption coefficients for colored dissolved organic material, particulate detritus and phytoplankton (analyzed by our group). We find that use of the Mitchell [1990] beta correction results in the overestimate of aph(675) by as much as 70%. We have conducted several experiments to produce a beta correction algorithm for PnB which produce much more reasonable results (Guillocheau, 2003). At PnB station 4 (the SB Channel center), profiles of most discrete determinations are made at 6 depths over the upper 75 m. This results in 13 discrete samples per PnB cruise. Hydrographic parameters are available from the CTD for analyses of water mass variability (Siegel et al., 2006a). A suite of inherent optical property (IOP) instrumentation is also deployed with the CTD/rosette system (WETLabs AC9 and HOBI Labs Hydroscat-6). This enables us to determine in situ profiles of spectral absorption, a(z,l), beam attenuation, c(z,l), total scattering b(z,l) and backscattering, bb(z,l), coefficients. Clear water calibrations are done for the AC9 instrumentation before each cruise using a Mille-Q clean water system dedicated for this task. Uncertainties in our clear water calibrations are typically within 0.015 m-1 which is more than a order of magnitude smaller than the signals that we sample. Further, we calibrate the backscatter meter before each cruise using a calibration fixture of HOBI Labs' design. Over time, this instrument has shown good stability (within 3%) in its factory calibration coefficients.",2008,2012

In all snow products and in remote sensing in general there is a tradeoff between spatial resolution and swath width (and thus frequency of observations). Because most hydrologic applications require regular frequent measurements the instruments that provide the bulk of the data used have been AVHRR and MODIS in the optical part of the spectrum with spatial resolutions of 1.1km and 500m at nadir and the passive microwave sensors with spatial resolutions of tens of kilometers. Because snow- covered area usually varies at a spatial scale finer than that of the resolution of the remote sensing instrument (i.e. the ground instantaneous field-of-view) this subpixel heterogeneity introduces artifacts into the measurements. The sensors usually measure radiation reflected or emitted from a mixture of snow rock soil and vegetation. We contend that the errors introduced by subpixel heterogeneity can be systematic and therefore they are not always eliminated by integrating over many pixels. We propose to develop a new set of products‚Äîsnowcovered area albedo and snow- water equivalence‚Äîthat fuse optical (MODIS AVHRR) and microwave data (SSM/R SSM/I AMSR-E and AMSR) and that incorporate spatial heterogeneity into the analysis. Data product creation and distribution will be provided through a local infrastructure for Earth science product management: a technology suite we call the Earth System Science Server (ES-cubed) an environment for managing the creation maintenance updating and dissemination of Earth science data products. The technology is based on the Microsoft TerraServer and runs on clusters of small computers.

The interpolation scheme has potential for operating in real time for seasonal runoff forecasting to inform decision-making. With 25 years of snow-covered area data the interpolation scheme can be used to examine peak SWE in Sierra Nevada River basins to investigate natural variability and trends. The approach examines patterns from estimates of the spatial distribution of snow from a retrospective energy balance method and thereby incorporates hypsometric and land cover characteristics of snow in the Sierra Nevada.

The overarching science objective is the development of an interpolation method to integrate satellite and in situ observations to produce real time estimates of spatially distributed SWE that can be used for runoff forecasting. The investigation addresses the NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) research objective to improve our capability to predict extreme events such as floods caused by rain on snow. I will use spectral mixing analysis to quantify fractional snow- covered area (fSCA) and an energy balance model to quantify SWE two key variables in the energy and water cycles that represent another SMD research objective.

The first and main study would look into the potential benefits of the UV bands to better discriminate between CDOM and phytoplankton light absorption. Currently, ocean color products are derived from bio-optical algorithms and models that use reflectance data from wavebands in the visible. Sub-surface chlorophyll- concentration (CHL) and the combined absorption of colored dissolved organic matter and detritic matter (CDM) are two typical products derived from ocean color data but it is often difficult to separate and accurately quantify them as both are strong absorbers at short visible wavelengths (typically 412 and 443 nm in ocean color sensors). The UV domain may offer the possibility to better discriminate between CHL and CDM as differences in their light absorption characteristics may be more pronounced in the UV. While CDM absorption in the UV is relatively well documented, there are much more uncertainties and variability in phytoplankton UV absorption. We thus propose to analyze in situ CDM and CHL absorption measurements that include UV bands from the largest and most diverse possible data set we will assemble from our own field campaigns (e.g. CLIVAR, BBOP, Plumes & Blooms), the NOMAD data set and the SeaBASS archive. We will then determine the optimal parameterization for the CHL and CDM absorption terms in the UV in our semi- analytical ocean color model (GSM) and conduct tests to assess the benefits and usefulness of these bands to accurately retrieve the CDM and CHL components during the inversion of spectral reflectance data similar to what the ACE ocean radiometer will provide.",2011,2012

The role that bedrock-channel incision plays in the evolution of tectonically active mountain belts has become a central topic in tectonic- geomorphology over the last two decades and has lead to the development of the stream power law which directly links erosional efficacy per unit area of the channel bed to discharge slope specific weight of water and channel-width. Previous studies have relied on simple power-law scalings to estimate channel-widths based on discharge while more sophisticated techniques have recently been proposed that are based on regionally limited data and/or contain fundamental underlying assumptions that preclude their ubiquitous application. Our research improves on previous studies of channel width scalings in orogenic systems by calibrating spatially ubiquitous ASTER imagery with higher resolution Google Earth imagery (GeoEye-1 and SPOT) and field surveys to yield reliable sub-pixel mixing models for application to width-extraction algorithms for the Himalaya. These channel widths will then be combined with ASTER GDEM topography (slopes) TRMM precipitation data (discharge) and MODIS imagery (snowcover and evapotranspiration values) into a specific stream power analysis (proxy for erosion) for the Himalaya.

These data will then be interpreted in the context of: the TRMM precipitation data and its variations along and across the Himalaya; topographic variations along the range; and model edindices of erosion that integrate rain fall topography and erosion models. Furthermore repeat ASTER imagery will be used to identify large land slides define spatial variations in land slide size and frequency and examine the correlations of these spatial variations with rain fall and topographic anomalies. This project's significance resides in three aspects. First we will develop some of the highest resolution data that has ever generated for large mountain belt with respect to relationships among erosion climate and topography. Second the integration and numerical exploration of these data will permit us to quantify the controls on erosion and the relationship of climate to climate on long and short timescales. Such studies are crucial for understanding how climate and tectonic interact to shape the landscape. Third we will be able to make statistical predictions of land slide hazards as a function of different rain fall scenarios in various regions of the Himalaya. This last contribution will directly affect societal risk assessment in the serugged mountains.",2008,2013

Space-borne satellites allow us to remotely sense light reflectance on spatial and temporal scales impossible to achieve by any other means. The remote-sensing reflectance of ocean waters, RRS (), is a function of the absorption and backscattering coefficients of seawater, termed inherent optical properties (IOP’s). IOP’s are in turn an additive function of seawater’s IOP’s (considered constant), and the IOP’s of in-water constituents, such as phytoplankton, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), detrital particulates and suspended sediments. Various empirical and semi-analytical algorithms exist to inversely model these bio-optical properties from ocean reflectance data (e.g., Maritorena et al. 2002). Both the Sea-viewing Wide Field of View Sensor (SeaWiFS) and the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are widely used satellite sensors for measuring ocean reflectance. Standard NASA algorithms (OC4v4 & OC3M) quantifies chlorophyll a concentration from ocean reflectance using an empirical relationship between RRS () and in situ measurements of chlorophyll a (O’Reilly et al., 1998 and updates). This algorithm works well for areas of the open ocean where ocean color is dominated by phytoplankton properties and other constituents are assumed to roughly covary with changes in chlorophyll a (IOCCG, 2000). The Garver-Siegel- Maritorena algorithm (GSM) is a semi-analytical model that quantifies three IOP’s from RRS (): backscattering due to particles, absorption of light due to phytoplankton and absorption of light due to dissolved and detrital organic material (Maritorena et al., 2002; Siegel et al., 2005). Empirical coefficients for the three IOP’s are determined by in situ measurements and held constant in the model based on a global data summary. Recent studies have shown that remote sensing is also a useful too for inversely modeling phytoplankton community structure (e.g., Alvain et al., 2008). Some phytoplankton pigments absorb and/or reflect light with a unique spectral shape. Alvain et al. (2006) was able to explain the variability in chlorophyll a concentrations modeled with the empirical algorithm by the direct relationship of LwN () spectral shape with phytoplankton community composition (Alvain et al, 2004; Alvain et al., 2006). Chemotaxonomic pigment data, used to identify phytoplankton groups or functional types, is becoming increasingly available and this novel approach will boost our understanding about community structure for the global ocean. Coastal areas can be optically complex due to high turbidity, primary productivity and CDOM from deepwater upwelling and/or river inputs and the associated IOP’s may vary independently (IOCCG, 2000). Such areas of optical complexity, termed Case II areas, often require local calibration for empirical coefficients used in remote sensing algorithms such as the GSM. Magnuson et al. (2004) found that locally tuning the GSM Model for the Chesapeake Bay and the Mid-Atlantic Bight resulted in better-calculated chlorophyll a measurements than the global GSM and OC4v4 Models. However, Kostadinov et al. (2007) locally calibrated the GSM Model for the Santa Barbara Channel (SBC) and found no improvement in model performance for any of the IOP’s compared with the global version of the GSM Model. The lack of model improvement was attributed to the assumption that spectral shape of the IOP’s is constant in time; therefore the empirical coefficients are held constant. IOP characteristics for the SBC are in fact much more dynamic. Taking a similar approach to that of Alvain et al. (2004), my overarching research 171 question is “How do changes in phytoplankton community structure influence inherent optical properties and thereby ocean color in a complex coastal ocean?”",2010,2013

Major refinements include 1) using yearly or seasonal averaged surface emissivities from C6 MODIS LST products as initial values in the day/night algorithm; 2) using multi-day Terra and Aqua MODIS data in a BRDF scheme for retrieving stable BRDF parameters in bands 20, 22 and 23 so that the angular variation in surface emissivities in all bands may be well modeled; 3) refining the MODIS cloudmask product collaboratively with the 228 cloudmask group to fix the discontinuity problem in LSTs along latitude of ±60o. The long-term quality and consistency of the MODIS LST/E products will be verified by science data analysis of the LST/E correlations with independent data sets of MODIS NDVI, surface observation data of precipitation and soil moisture. Combined with surface emissivity spectra measured by a high- quality TIR Fourier-transfer spectroradiometer with a sun-shadow method in the field and by a TIR spectroradiometer and integrating sphere system in laboratory from terrestrial samples, atmospheric temperature and water vapor profiles from conventional radiosonde and NCEP will be used in a radiance-based approach to validate the LST products over 40 sites on the global land.

These highly seasonal glacial meltwaters have immediate consequences for the water food and power supplies of densely populated regions in adjacent countries including Peru and Bolivia. In the central Andes glacial mass- balance studies are extremely rare and both spatially and temporally limited. While glacial inventories exist in this region they are incomplete and the databases do not contain crucial parameters such as debris coverage a parameter increasingly gaining attention in predicting and understanding glacial mass balance changes. As a result quantifying the extent of the disequilibrium of these central Andean tropical glaciers remains a challenge and observation and understanding of these terrestrial water stores and fluxes remains poorly constrained despite their importance for downstream populations. Glacial dynamics are not uniform throughout the central Andes. However the degree to which varying parameters affect glacial volumetric changes has not been systematically investigated for the tropical glaciers of Peru and Bolivia. For example large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns (e.g. ENSO) are known to be a dominant forcing factor determining glacial advance and retreat in this region yet this impact has not been consistently quantified. This study will use Digital Elevation Models produced from Corona (~1970s) and ASTER (2000-2010) stereo pairs and the SRTM (2000) to quantify volumetric changes. Additionally areal changes and debris coverage will be analyzed with Landsat TM/ETM+ and ASTER imagery in combination with glacial surface velocities derived from image cross-correlation techniques. This four-decade long timeseries will be used to investigate the spatial variability of central Andean glacial dynamics in relation to glacial debris cover topographic (e.g. elevation relief channel slope) and climatic (seasonality and impact of ENSO) factors. Data and results derived from these remote-sensing based measurements and novel techniques will contribute to an improved inventory and understanding of varying parameters on glacial change in the Andes.,2011,2013

However, our ability to remotely assess carbon export rates globally remains primitive at best as carbon export is most commonly estimated as the product of remotely sensed values of net primary production (NPP) multiplied by a very simple export-ratio model. These models may provide a reasonable assessment of present state of mean carbon export, but they will not assess changes in export as these are purely empirical models and none of the critical information about mechanisms driving export are included. To make that next step towards a mechanistic assessment of ocean carbon flux we need knowledge of upper ocean particle source material concentrations and characteristics and knowledge of how physical oceanographic processes alter upper ocean particle fields and package suspended materials into sinking particles that are exported into the ocean interior. Here we propose a coupled field, imagery analysis and modeling program aimed at understanding the mechanisms driving carbon export and developing novel tools for its remote assessment. Specifically, we will conduct two ~3200 km long meridional transects across the North Atlantic (~40 to 20oN) collaborating with the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series (BATS). We will sample carbon export (via 234Th disequilibria) from vertical water samples and surface samples from underway collection (with 10 km spatial resolution). Concentrations of the radioisotope thorium-234 are an excellent index for euphotic zone particle removal as measured by its disequilibrium with its parent (238U) and recent technical advances enable its high spatial resolution sampling from a ship’s underway flow system. Upper ocean particle concentrations and characteristics will be sampled by measuring inherent optical properties, phytoplankton abundances and pigments, size-fractionated inherent optical property and chlorophyll concentrations, particulate organic carbon, transparent exopolymer particle (TEP) concentrations, and the particle size distribution (PSD) spectrum. These observations will be made both underway from the ship’s surface underway system and as vertical profiles. This work will constrain the types and concentrations of particles and processes that are leading to particle export. Satellite ocean color observations of inherent optical properties and the PSD will be integrated into the interpretation of the field observations. A key element of our proposal is the simultaneous observations of particle export and source material characteristics and the physical drivers of particle aggregation. Recent modeling studies have shown that Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCSs) can be determined from merged satellite altimetry observations. LCSs define the attracting and repelling surfaces in 2-D flow fields and provide an excellent, diagnostic tool for 176 assessing regions where submesoscale particle aggregation will occur as well as vertical motions at fronts. The relationships among LCS locations and intensities will be evaluated using observations from the ship transects and from advance ocean color data products. The proposed combination of high-resolution field observations, remote sensing data analysis and assessment of LCSs is a unique feature of our work.",2011,2014

Along with required determination of the spectral normalized water-leaving radiance, the chlorophyll concentration is the oldest ocean color variable derived from satellite ocean color data because of the relative ease of its derivation and validation as well as it provides a link to net primary production (NPP) rates. Thanks to advances in both the theory of ocean color and measurements of core variables over the last couple decades many innovative science products can now be derived from satellite measurements. These new algorithms include the satellite determination of inherent optical properties (e.g., Maritorena et al. 2002; Lee et al., 2002; Siegel et al. 2002; 2005a; 2005b; IOCCG, 2006; Hoge and Lyon, 2005; Hu et al. 2006; Loisel et al. 2001; 2006; Lee and Hu, 2006), discrimination of phytoplankton functional groups (Alvain et al., 2005, 2006, Brown and Yoder, 1994; Westberry et al. 2005; Westberry and Siegel, 2006), near-direct assessments of phytoplankton physiology (e.g., Behrenfeld et al. 2005; 2006; Westberry et al. 2007) and the algorithm based merging of satellite data streams (Maritorena and Siegel, 2005).

Present-day numerical models used to simulate global ocean biogeochemical cycles parameterize both the function and the size of components of the plankton community. However, there is still precious little observational data to validate the results of these model simulations of plankton community structure and their biogeochemical impacts. In recent years, new capabilities have been developed to assess phytoplankton community structure and organic carbon cycling from satellite ocean color observations. However, validation of these novel remote sensing retrieval approaches and their further development is limited by scarcity of field observations over the variety of biogeochemical provinces of the global ocean. Since 2003, we have been studying the distribution and dynamics and implications of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the global ocean ""piggybacking"" on hydrographic sections of the CO2/CLIVAR Repeat Hydrography Project. With NASA support, we have collected and analyzed radiometric profiles, particle and CDOM absorption spectra, and surface phytoplankton pigment (HPLC and fluorometric chlorophyll a) data. To date we have collected a broad and diverse data set from the North and Equatorial Atlantic, North and South Pacific, and Indian Ocean basins with some lines continuing through the Southern Ocean to the Antarctic. Our major science achievement to date resulted in a new understanding of the relative roles of biogeochemical vs. ventilation on subsurface CDOM distributions. This work also has provided considerable validation data in poorly sampled areas of the ocean. 144 Here, we propose to continue this effort on upcoming CO2/CLIVAR sections in the Arabian Sea, South Atlantic, Southern Ocean, and North Atlantic, and to further enhance the program by adding a newly constructed flow-through system that will also measure surface inherent optical properties (IOPs) such as spectral absorption, backscattering and particle size spectra (and chlorophyll and CDOM fluorescence), in whole water and 0.2 micron filtered water. Our field effort will be closely coupled to our ongoing collaborative efforts in developing new ocean color products useful for assessing global productivity and carbon cycling. The combination of field and satellite data analyses will enable us to understand the controls on plankton community structure allowing an understanding of the processes by which phytoplankton community structure affects open ocean IOPs and how one can best assess community structure characteristics from IOPs.",2009,2014

Wind relaxation events plumes and blooms are some of the mechanisms responsible for the mixing and transport of organic and inorganic materials such as larvae nutrients pollutants and sediments along the continental shelf. In the Santa Barbara Channel (SBC) California these mechanisms cause dramatic changes in the color of the ocean on time scales of days to weeks. The variability of ocean color on short timescales has not been well characterized or accounted for by satellite remote sensing due to revisit time and sampling issues which makes such observations impossible. Moreover many ocean processes tend to develop under overcast conditions when no imagery or in situ data is being collected biasing the assessment of those systems to clear sky conditions. Underestimation of ocean productivity is also expected because phytoplankton pigmentation adapts to changes in light availability and we might be biasing satellite observations of phytoplankton biomass to high light clear sky conditions. My research objective is to characterize the variability of bio-optical properties on time scales of days to weeks in the Santa Barbara Channel and account for the observations that have been missed by satellite systems due to unfavorable meteorological conditions. An electric glider will be used to make repeated bio-optical and physical measurements of the water column during plumes blooms and relaxation events at excellent temporal and spatial resolutions nearly independent of weather conditions. An extensive set of in situ data will be synthesized and used to complement NASA satellite ocean color data.

We used optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy to measure snow grain geometry and chemical composition. Our findings agree with laboratory experiments and sintering theory. Because of the time required for sampling and microscopy we sampled in just two locations. We now plan to extend our sampling to learn how stratigraphy and sintering vary spatially. Other studies we recently published examine how spatial variability is the driving mechanism that produces power laws in avalanche depth distributions. We will use a new method near-infrared digital photography for rapid quantitative stratigraphy and to cover the range of variability over a large mountain. We will apply this technique to snow stability evaluation and the general study of snow metamorphism. Since the measurement of snow properties with near-infrared photography is a new technique it has not been widely used and there are no peer-reviewed studies that apply it to snow stability. While the heterogeneity of grain sizes at the snow surface has been investigated with remote sensing there are many fewer studies of the heterogeneity of snow properties in buried layers especially at the slope scale. Our experience extensive instrumentation site accessibility and large number of avalanche control records make our field location Mammoth Mountain an ideal site to test how near-infrared photography can be used for avalanche hazard evaluation. We will relate mechanical strength to specific signs of instability called lemons i.e. yellow flags. We propose that four of five common lemons can be identified with nearinfrared photography alone. We will also use spatial statistics and machine-learning techniques to classify stable and unstable near-infrared snow profiles.

We propose to modify the GSM model so it can account for fluorescence which should help better constraint the model and improve Chlorophyll and phytoplankton absorption retrievals in both oceanic and coastal waters. Although MODIS does not have UV bands we also propose to extend the GSM model into the UV region to help discriminate better between phytoplankton and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption which are not well separated by the current 412 nm band in ocean color sensors. In upgrading GSM we also plan on making it fully hyperspectral so it can be adapted and applied to MODIS and other sensors. Model development and later tests and validations of the different components of the model will performed using existing in situ data from our field campaigns and other existing public data sets. The model will be adapted to the MODIS bands and applied to the satellite data. In parallel we will conduct a complete error and uncertainty analysis of the model and data as we have done in the past. In summary our objectives are to: - Develop and add a fluorescence module for the GSM model - Investigate and add a UV component to the GSM model - Make the GSM model hyperspectral and adaptable to multispectral sensors like MODIS - Develop a complete end-to-end error budget (inputs model outputs) - Apply the model and error budget to the MODIS data,2011,2015

Snowmelt runoff forecasting in mountainous areas such as the western United States has developed as empirical models forced by sparse in situ measurements of snow water equivalent that lie primarily in subalpine regions. Not only do the seasonal forecast models already have large errors in some years they rely on a data record that assumes stationarity and therefore are theoretically ill suited for water manage- ment in a changing climate. Moreover they are unable to accurately address water resources during extreme events such as persisting spring snow or new snowfall in the alpine zone above almost all measurement sites. In response to this need for better assessment of the snow resource in mountain areas new Earth System Data Records that use MODIS data have become available. However they have not been rigorously validated and uncertainties and the possible presence of systematic error are not known. In this investigation we propose to undertake this necessary validation through four years because the products will evolve. The specific Earth System Data Records are: Daily MODIS fractional snow cover. MODIS fractional snow cover based on the normalized difference snow index originally developed for Landsat [Dozier 1989; Hall et al. 2006] available from Terra (product MOD10A1) since 2000 and from Aqua (product MYD10A1) since 2002 [Salomonson and Appel 2004 2006]. MODIS fractional snow cover based on spectral mixing [Painter et al. 2009] available for the Sierra Nevada since 2000 but produced on demand for any MODIS scene. The al- gorithm will be used for the NOAA/NOHRSC National Snow Model starting in water year 2010-11 and has been adopted for the GOES-R Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) sched- uled for launch in the 2015 timeframe. Snow albedo of the fractional snow cover based on choosing the snow endmember from spectral mixing that minimizes the residual error [Painter et al. 2009]. A snow albedo prod- uct is also available for the normal ‚Äúbinary‚Äù (snow vs no-snow) snow-covered area product [Klein and Stroeve 2002] but it is usually applied to continuous snow cover. MODIS fractional snow cover and albedo smoothed and interpolated across time and space to compensate for cloud cover off-nadir viewing and data dropouts [Dozier et al. 2008]. The analyses are available as monthly data cubes during the snow seasons for the Sierra Nevada since 2000. The coupling presented here of fractional snow cover and the albedo of that snow provides water managers with spatially and temporally dense data records that populate modeling in- puts for forecasting and research. Their use in snowmelt models and reservoir operations would be advanced by our proposed investigation which would validate the products analyze the structure of errors and advise users of caveats and likely accuracy. Of greatest interest is their potential combination with surface data and energy balance models to help estimate the -1-spatial distribution of snow water equivalent (SWE). SWE can be interpolated in near real time from snow pillow and snow course measurements constraining the surface measurements by satellite snow-cover estimates [Fassnacht et al. 2003]. In addition SWE can be reconstructed from satellite snow-cover estimates and snow-depletion models [Martinec and Rango 1981; Cline et al. 1998; Molotch 2009].,2011,2015

To judge feasibility the proposed effort looks at two regions a validation case and a case representing the characteristics outlined above. For the validation case we propose to use the Sierra Nevada of California a mountain range of extensive historical study emerging scientific innovation and conflicting priorities in managing water for agriculture urban areas hydropower recreation habitat and flood control. For the austere regional focus we will examine southwest and south Asia where some of the most persistent drought in the world causes food insecurity and combines with political instability and occasional flooding to affect US national security. Our approach will use a mix of satellite data and a spare modeling approach to present information essential for planning and decision making ranging from optimization of proposed infrastructure projects to assessment of water resources stored as snow for seasonal forecasts. We will combine optical imagery (MODIS on Terra/Aqua VIIRS on NPP) passive microwave data (SSM/I AMSR-E) retrospective reconstruction with energy balance calculations and gridded feed-forward uncoupled land surface modeling to establish retrospective context. Specifically we will use the period spanning the decade-long record from Terra and Aqua to bracket the historical record. In the California Sierra Nevada surface measurements have sufficient spatial and temporal resolution for us to validate our approach which we will extend to the Hindu Kush of High Asia where surface data are sparse and where access presents significant difficulties. The world's mountains accumulate substantial snow and in some areas produce the bulk of the runoff. In ranges like Afghanistan's Hindu Kush availability of water resources affects US policy martial and humanitarian operations and national security. The rugged terrain makes surface measurements difficult and also affects the analysis of remotely sensed data. The analysis would leverage several techniques developed from NASA-sponsored research and use NASA instruments. While using data from the Sierra Nevada for validation the activity would also improve water resource assessment in that region where statistically based forecasts occasionally produce significantly errors.

We will use existing and new satellite (ALOS PALSAR Landsat TM) aerial (historic aerial photography and videography) and socioeconomic data sets to address the following questions: 1) What have been the main trends in land cover change in the Lower Amazon region over the last fifty years? 2) What are the economic strategies of the three main groups of resource users: ranchers smallholders and commercial fishers?3) What has been the impact of the settlement and co-management policies now being implemented on land and resource use and floodplain vegetation cover?4) How might climate induced changes in the Amazon flood regime impact floodplain land and resource use and consequently vegetation cover?

Recently we have added an automated system that measures surface particulate backscattering spectral particle absorption and attenuation and particle size distribution to our suite of measurements allowing us to study the impact of plankton community structure on the remotely-?sensible optical properties. Uncertainty in ship availability and scheduling for CLIVAR expeditions has in recent years made planning ahead for cruises through the conventional grant process challenging. We have an opportunity to participate in two expeditions in the Pacific in 2014 and 2015 and are submitting a Rapid Response proposal accordingly. We propose to analyze CDOM samples collected by the GSFC field team on the P16S expedition to the South Pacific and Southern Ocean in early 2014 and to mount a full effort with our own field team on the early 2015 P16N expedition to the equatorial and North Pacific along the 152W line.

First, merged products offer improved coverage of the ocean at daily to monthly time scales, which reduces the uncertainties in estimates derived from those products for both local and global studies. Second, merged data products often have lower uncertainties than the same product from any single sensor. Last, data merging has also proven a powerful tool to identify inconsistencies among the different data sources or issues with the sensors’ radiometry. In all, data merging benefits both the ocean color and biogeochemistry science that uses its data and the inter-sensors calibration/validation activities. Here, we propose to continue the development of unified and coherent ocean color time series through the merging of data from multiple sensors. We will continue the development of merged ocean color products from the GSM semi-analytical model. This model merges data at the Remote sensing reflectance level and derives several biogeochemically relevant data products simultaneously along with uncertainty estimates at each pixel. In addition, we will also generate merged products from higher level data (e.g. chlorophyll- a concentration) as such products are no longer available to the science community. We will also develop new merged ocean color products. In particular, we will develop a merged remote sensing reflectance product that will allow users to work with a data set with improved spectral resolution and lower uncertainties.

Because of rugged terrain political instability and the meager measurement infrastructure remotely sensed measurements must play a crucial role. The proposal is to hold two follow-on workshops to the initial one in January 2015 in Kathmandu which the NASA Earth Science Division and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth (RADI) co-organized with the assistance of the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD). Scientists in both the U.S. and China use satellite and field data provided by both and carry out field work throughout High Mountain Asia. CAS has operated a glacier field station in the Tien Shan since the 1958 International Geophysical Year. Several U.S. scientists have worked in the region and published findings that analyze Chinese data. A face-to-face workshop allows us to fully characterize the data available learn about ongoing work on snow glaciers and hazards in High Mountain Asia and best specify how a Glacier Melt Tool will advance science worldwide. At the Kathmandu workshop participants identified a set of priority themes and began to define specific collaborations that take advantage of strengths and resources of NASA and CAS that include satellite and airborne sensing field measurements and modeling. To further these collaborations we established three working groups-- process research and modeling data sharing and exchange and validation--to begin work on a Glacier Melt Tool to support monitoring process understanding and future projections of glaciers and snow in High Mountain Asia. The two subsequent workshops--one in the U.S. and the next in Beijing--will provide more specific guidance about research needed to understand changing climate and implications of human impacts on glaciers and using Earth observations how the changing cryosphere in High Mountain Asia alters the risks of hazards and how societal impacts on communities in the region might be mitigated. The recent earthquake in the region illustrates how the combination of tremors snow and ice and avalanches has devastated villages and raises the hope--indeed the expectation--that scientific and technological resources of NASA and CAS could help restore Nepalese communities and lessen the consequences of future events. The September 9-11 2015 workshop at Mammoth Mountain California will consist of a few keynote talks invited presentations that build on the work presented in Kathmandu in January posters that illustrate relevant recent work by the attendees and their students and break-out meetings of the working groups. Invitations to attend will be extended to the participants in the January workshop along with a few others who were not able to attend that one. Because of lower costs associated with a meeting in the U.S. instead of Nepal we will encourage attendance by some advanced graduate students also. We will cap attendance at 65 participants with travel support for 31. The third meeting in Beijing to be scheduled in early 2016 will enable us to finalize all recommendations and formulate goals. At that meeting we will conclude preparation of publishable papers that lay out strategies for future research. The Chinese Academy of Sciences will host that meeting. This proposal includes travel support for 25 U.S. attendees who are not Civil Servants. ,2015,2017

The long-term studies being carried out at the U.S. JGOFS Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) site (Steinberg et al. 2001) are providing a decade-scale view of the current state of the ocean climate and its changes while the hydrographic measurements at Hydrostation S provide a record of ocean climate change over the last half century. The long baseline of these time series reveals patterns and processes that are not visible within shorter studies. In particular the BATS record of the inorganic carbon system (Bates et al 2012; Figure 1) shows a strong trend in increasing CO2 and decreasing pH and aragonite saturation state. This trend may be a strong driver of the biological community that we can detect and analyze using bio-optical techniques. Our research within this time series context has focused on developing and applying methods for extending the reach of in situ time-series of oceanographic studies by using optical and remote sensing data to provide novel information and spatial context. Our past and ongoing research efforts have been oriented toward analyzing the linkages between ocean optical properties (as measured in situ and from spaceborne sensors) and biogeochemical processes such as CDOM cycling and primary productivity as modulated by seasonal cycles and mesoscale processes. Previous and ongoing studies have also made use of BBOP in situ data in combination with imagery and other sensor data from EOS and related platforms in both algorithm development validation and in answering science questions. BBOP has also contributed significantly to data records required for deriving new products from ocean color data and toward the validation of current spaceborne radiometric sensors and algorithms. Our goals for this project are to continue the time series of high quality observations at the BATS site carry out studies of the long-term data set transition to the new platform and reprocess and quality control the historic data set using new community derived standards. ,2014,2018

The core element of the PnB program is the monthly day-long sampling of 7 stations across the Santa Barbara Channel. At each station a full suite of bio-optical and oceanographic measurements is sampled and nearly 80 stations are completed each year. Coupled with the highly dynamic nature of the SBC the PnB data are incredibly useful for answering coastal ocean color science questions and for validating satellite data products. PnB field observations started in 1996 and they have continued continuously to the present. ,2014,2018
135p,David Siegel James Allen,9/1/15,8/31/18,105000,National Aeronautics and Space Administration,Federal agencies,NNX15AN87H,Retrieval of Phytoplankton Size Distribution from Satellite Imagery,Knowledge about the size composition and distribution of particles in the global ocean has led to breakthroughs in understanding surface ecosystem dynamics as well as the oceans role in the Earths carbon cycle. Remote sensing has recently become a powerful tool for characterizing the global particle size distribution (PSD) and phytoplankton size composition on relevant spatiotemporal scales through the use of two distinct optical modeling approaches. Spectral backscattering models perform well in oligotrophic marine regions due to the lack of terrestrially derived particles while spectral absorption models work well in productive regions due to their ability to key into the flattening of spectral absorption features in larger particles due to the package effect. However these models often fail because they do not address the bio-optical complexity of the ocean. The proposed work will improve on current studies by developing a novel algorithm that merges PSD information from both particle backscattering and absorption spectra. These new models as well as existing techniques applied to remotely sensed imagery from SeaWiFS MODIS-Aqua and Suomi VIIRS will be validated with available PSD field data. This allows for a detailed analysis of model sensitivities to changes in input variables while providing the ability to reconcile phytoplankton vs. particle size distributions. The power law size distribution assumption will also be reassessed in favor of a two-component model made up of fine and coarse modes following approaches used by the atmospheric aerosol community. ,2015,2018

The expected usefulness of the UV bands for ocean color sensors is two-fold: 1) they should allow a better discrimination between phytoplankton and CDOM -through their inherent optical properties IOPS-in the ocean and 2) they can help in the atmospheric correction when absorbing aerosols are present. They PACE UV bands are expected to help mostly in coastal and turbid waters where both high amounts of CDOM and the presence of absorbing aerosols are frequent. Because both CDOM and absorbing aerosol show increased absorption toward short wavelengths confounding effects may limit the ability of the UV bands to discern the role of CDOM and aerosols in the remote sensing signal. Here we propose to test the use of the PACE UV bands for both IOP retrievals and atmospheric correction. We will test the performance of a semi-analytic ocean color algorithm (an upgraded version of the GSM model) for the retrieval of IOPs using available in situ data that cover the UV and visible domains. Using simulated data we will also test how perturbations in the NIR and SWIR atmospheric bands affect the spectral IOP retrievals (from UV to the green wavelengths). Last we will test if the UV bands can be used to better constrain the aerosol path radiance and improve atmospheric correction. Some of these analyses will also be considered with the HICO data. ,2014,2018

A substantial but highly uncertain portion of this organic carbon ultimately sinks into the deeper ocean where it is sequestered for years to millennia significantly affecting the Earths climate. This process known as the oceans biological carbon pump both governs and responds to changes in Earths climate on decadal to millennial timescales. This project develops new mechanistic observationally-constrained models to address substantial uncertainties surrounding the operation of the biological pump in the contemporary ocean and its response to climate change. This project aims to: (i) Quantify how much carbon the biological pump delivers to the deep ocean on an annual basis and how long this carbon is sequestered in the deep ocean; (ii) Develop mechanistic models relating biological pump processes to remotely sensed variables so that the biological pump can be monitored from space; (iii) Quantify the environmental sensitivities of key biological pump processes so that climate predictions can be improved; (iv) Develop a new framework for assimilation and integration of satellite and oceanographic data to maximize the useful information from space-based and ocean observing systems. The primary novelty of this project is that it integrates both satellite and in-situ oceanographic observations in the context of a global ocean circulation and biogeochemistry inverse model. Each data source provides unique constraints on different important parts of the biological pump. Satellites sense surface biological properties such as productivity and ecosystem size structure while oceanographic tracers integrate information on the rates and pathways of organic carbon decomposition. By combining the two this project aims to develop models that have the potential to change how NASA resources will be used to monitor and quantify the oceans carbon cycle. ,2016,2019

Despite this necessity current satellite-based NPP estimates have significant uncertainties as evidenced by the wide variation between different satellite NPP products. This is due in part to a lack of adequate validation of model parameters used to produce these estimates. Efforts to validate models have been made but the in-situ data used for validation has generally been too limited either spatially temporally or both to accurately extrapolate NPP estimates on a global scale. The work seeks to improve these NPP estimates through assimilation of global-scale in-situ oceanographic tracer data with satellite-based observations. The work will produce biogeochemically-consistent NPP estimates that can be applied to data from satellite-based sensors such as MODIS-Aqua Suomi VIIRS and the upcoming PACE mission along with potential to support NASA projects such as the EXport Processes in the Ocean from Remote Sensing (EXPORTS).,2018,2019

The considerable uncertainty about the estimated fluxes of methane stems from the large seasonal and inter-annual variations in ecological conditions and inundation typical of floodplains and other wetlands. In this proposed project we will combine results from our field measurements hydrological simulations and advances in remote sensing to develop mechanistic models that couple floodplain inundation dynamics to the production and emission of methane. Our work will quantify and reduce uncertainty associated with estimates of methane fluxes and expand understanding of their temporal and spatial variability. Our results will provide necessary inputs to regional atmospheric models of methane fluxes derived from airborne campaigns and satellite retrievals and provide key improvements in the tropics for models applied globally. Among tropical river systems the Amazon basin is the largest and has the most extensive floodplains. Hence our analyses will focus on aquatic systems in the Amazon basin and be extended to tropical systems elsewhere based on modeling and remote sensing. Remote sensing of inundation and vegetative dynamics will be combined with recent results from in situ measurements of methane fluxes related physical processes and hydrological models to provide regional estimates of methane fluxes. We will utilize existing datasets complemented by focused field studies to develop and validate a model of methane evasion tailored to tropical aquatic systems with strong seasonal and inter-annual variations in inundation water depths and vegetative cover. ,2017,2020

The monitoring and prediction of global carbon export and time scales for its sequestration remain important unknowns of the oceans carbon cycle. To attack this problem NASA is implementing the EXport Processes in the Ocean from RemoTe Sensing (EXPORTS) field campaign. The goal of EXPORTS is to gain a predictive understanding of the export and fates of global ocean net primary production (NPP). The EXPORTS Science Plan focuses on quantifying the pathways in which NPP is exported from the upper ocean and is sequestered at depth. The EXPORTS field campaign as planned will likely observe maybe eight distinct ecosystem / carbon cycling states; yet its plan is to answer its science questions by performing longitudinal analyses of observations made across a range of states. Unfortunately the statistical confidence in these results may be quite poor as only a small number of realizations may be afforded from the field program alone. The good news is that there are many sites where high-quality ecosystem / carbon cycling observations are available from online repositories and literature accounts from previous and ongoing research programs. Because of the available of these data the data mining of available observations is an integral part of the EXPORTS Science Plan and likely critical to its success. This pilot study will assess how to address the EXPORTS Science Questions by data mining previous observations. Specifically our objectives are to: 1) Collect and collate available global ocean ecosystem and carbon cycling field observations useful for addressing the EXPORTS Science Questions; 2) Construct EXPORTS data products and wiring diagrams from available data and distribute and publish them for their wide use and; 3) Evaluate the use of the mined data products for assessing the EXPORTS Science Questions and developing advanced satellite algorithms and numerical models. ,2016,2020

Given the excessive time and cost required to study these distributions on significant temporal and spatial scales developing the use of ocean color remote sensing as a means to monitor these distributions is of great interest to oceanographers. Thus many efforts have been made to develop relationships between optical properties such as remote sensing reflectance and spectral absorption and backscattering coefficients and phytoplankton community structure which is generally characterized in these efforts by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Recent advances in the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) as a taxonomic method have provided a new way to characterize microbial community structure and diversity in situ but its utility in studies linking optical signatures with diversity has yet to be examined. The goal of the proposed research is to further elucidate the two-way linkage in in situ optical signatures and phytoplankton community structure and to develop a relationship between these optical signatures and the non-photosynthetic microbial community by employing a combination of HPLC and NGS. ,2016,2020

Satellite algorithm maintenance requires the comparison of remote sensing data products with both coincident field observations as well as satellite data products from similar sensors. The SBC and its surrounding waters is an excellent location for this task due to the inherent large spatial and temporal variations in ocean and atmospheric optical properties. We propose to quality assure the MODIS Aqua ocean color algorithms using observations in a complex coastal system. Of particular relevance are algorithms for remote sensing reflectance spectra chlorophyll a concentration and inherent optical properties. MODIS ocean color data products are operationally produced by the NASA GSFC ocean color data processing group and are used regularly by the ocean sciences community. Maintenance of satellite algorithm requires quality assessment of MODIS Aqua satellite data products with both field observations as well as relevant satellite data products from other platforms (VIIRS OLCI etc.). We will analyze MODIS Aqua Level-2 satellite data products for the SBC and its surrounding waters through matchups to field observations and their intercomparison with (Henderikx Freitas et al. 2016).

Refine the existing conceptual model of the relationship between surface ecosystems subsurface biogeochemical characteristics microbial respiration and transfer efficiency of carbon through the mesopelagic. 3 Develop a predictive subsurface particle remineralization model that can be incorporated into EXPORTS data products. To accomplish these objectives we will deploy replicated sets of particle capture devices equipped with oxygen optode-based respiration chambers throughout the mesopelagic during the EXPORTS field campaigns. These systems known as RESPIRE traps allow for the in situ capture of sinking particles and subsequent tracking of oxygen consumption. We will compare respiration rates to subsurface ecosystem and biogeochemical characteristics including particle sinking rates geochemical characterization of particles and microbial community structure. We will further compare our results to remotely-sensed properties such as net primary production phytoplankton community composition and particle size spectra to determine the mechanistic basis for the relationship between surface ocean properties and subsurface activity.

Recent advances in macroalgal biofuel production techniques have spurred action to develop offshore kelp farms to utilize natural pools of available nutrients and produce kelp biomass as a novel US energy production stream. To maximize kelp biomass yields managers must be able to monitor the progression of the kelp farm starting at outplant and continuing through the growth cycle to harvest with information on biomass productivity and physiological status as well as the environmental conditions that control its near-term production. The rapid growth rate of this species along with the ever- present potential of biomass losses due to frond senescence herbivory and fouling amplify the requirement of real time autonomous monitoring data to assist in optimizing the operation of a giant kelp aquaculture farm. The Scalable Aquaculture Monitoring System (SAMS) addresses these needs by continuously assessing underwater and floating kelp biomass physiological condition and production along with the environmental factors known to affect kelp growth all while delivering relevant information to the farm manager in real time. SAMS is composed of aerial and underwater autonomous vehicles and sensors tested and validated to provide the most efficient suite of instruments delivering the required metrics at the plant scale while maintaining the scalability to monitor multiple giant kelp farms simultaneously. ,2017,2021

Snow cover and now albedo are important properties used to estimate snow water equivalent (SWE) and snowmelt. Daily observations of snow cover and snow albedo are available from MODIS Terra and Suomi NPP VIIRS at a resolution of 500 m and 1 km respectively but snow properties vary at an order of magnitude smaller scales. Finer scale observations at 30 m from satellites such as Landsat 5 7 and 8 are available but only at 16-day intervals.

This proposal contributes to this effort by investigating the relationships between intraseasonal variations associated with the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) non-MJO variability and air-sea interaction processes that are relevant to the theory of stochastic forcing of ENSO. The proposed research is based on a comprehensive observational analysis and focuses on the influence of intraseasonal oscillations on synoptic-to-intraseasonal anomalies in surface wind stress and heat fluxes their coupled and uncoupled (stochastic) structures. The specific objectives of this proposal are 1) Characterize periods of MJO and non-MJO intraseasonal variations including their interannual variability; 2) Examine the associations between the variability of the MJO and synoptic and intraseasonal variations in surface wind stress and heat fluxes in the tropical Pacific; 3) Determine the relative importance of non-MJO intraseasonal variability on the modulation of surface wind stress and heat fluxes; 4) Investigate the spatial and temporal characteristics of coupled and uncoupled (stochastic) components of surface wind stress and heat fluxes.

The wet season peaks in the core of the Amazon in austral summer while deep convection begins to weaken over the Amazon in early March and the dry season persists throughout most of the austral winter. It has been increasingly common to refer to this strong summertime convective activity intense precipitation and large-scale atmospheric circulation features as the South American monsoon system (SAMS).

Thus the Last Millennium Climate Reanalysis (LMR) provides a good opportunity to build knowledge and understand how the global atmospheric circulation and Arctic climates were interlinked and how they evolved together on interdecadal to centennial time scales in the past millennium especially due to changing natural and anthropogenic external forcing. Indeed preliminary results offered in this proposal suggest that there exists an observed low frequency teleconnection between tropical SSTs and the Arctic in the past 60 years and a similar teleconnection could exist in a long integration of CESM that is not subject to external forcing. Thus our working hypothesis is that in the past millennium a low frequency SST variability in the tropics could generate and maintain a teleconnection pattern propagating toward the Arctic to cause an abrupt warming through changing the local circulation. In this project we aim to test this hypothesis using LMR data and CESM and develop a physical understanding of this tropical-Arctic linkage and its responses under changing natural and anthropogenic external forcing. ,2018,2020

Information that can improve early season decision-making therefore benefits a wide range of end-users. In the Western U.S. where snow accounts for a large fraction of the annual water budget one of the largest sources of uncertainty in subseasonal to seasonal water forecasts is snowpack. The NOAA National Water Model (NWM) includes a subseasonal (30-day aka ""long-range"") forecasting module which predicts precipitation snowpack water storage and release and streamflow. This particular NWM product is currently underutilized by water managers and resource planners in part due to unfamiliarity with the system high uncertainties in the estimates and lack of grounding in the observational datasets commonly used by managers. We propose to address these current deficiencies by assimilating a new near-real-time suite of remote-sensing-based snow products into the NWM. The foundation of our methodology is a post-processing algorithm developed by NSIDC to create daily spatially and temporally consistent estimates of fractional snow-covered area clean snow albedo and dust radiative forcing products which perform better than traditional MODIS snow products. UCSB will expand this product suite in high-priority target regions with near-real-time snow water equivalent (SWE estimates derived by a novel machine-learning algorithm trained on the NSIDC remote-sensing suite and a historical SWE reconstruction model. To bring this rich data suite into the NWM NCAR has devised an ensemble particle-filter assimilation method to winnow the long-range forecast ensemble set to ""optimal"" combinations of model parameters and forecasts that best replicate the snow observations. To test the new framework the team will conduct a system-level demonstration of the NWM long-range forecast configuration for the 2018-2019 period with weekly regional snow state and parameter updates including full computational benchmarking and feasibility assessment for U.S.-wide implementation. The long-range configuration is ideally suited for our data-model fusion approach. Its simpler process representation and faster computational speeds allow parameter and forcing ensembles to become computationally tractable permitting seamless assimilation of high-quality high-impact observations like the NSIDC snow suite. With modest effort we believe this expanded system will make substantial improvements in the accuracy and relevance of the NWM seasonal forecasts to water resource managers. ",2018,2020

This work is occurring in an area of both great natural resources and intensive human activity with complex and potentially conflicting goals articulated by the Merced Wild and Scenic River Final Comprehensive Management Plan and Environmental Impact Statement issued in February 2014. Since the initiation of this project the work accomplished has comprised field data collection data compilation channel-migration modeling in-stream project design and construction monitoring stakeholder outreach and preparation of a comprehensive report on scientific activities to date. As a result of this work we have developed and completed a map-based characterization of channel attributes throughout the study area contributed to the in-progress geologic map of the valley participated in multiple stakeholder meetings and provided engineering design and construction oversight on two in-stream projects constructed in the valley since initiation of the project. Research questions have been framed relating to the past and future behavior of this river given a range of potential management prescriptions for riparian areas and under potential climate-change scenarios. ,2015,2020

Currently large portions of formerly occupied watersheds are now completely extirpated due to human-induced factors such as fish stocking and the importation of disease. Even when these factors are reversed or stabliized remnant yellow-legged from populations are often too small and at risk of local extinction to act as sources fro reintroduction. In order for the Park Service to fulfill its mission of recovering this listed species a ground-breaking new approach is being proposed to preserve as much genetic diversity as possible while there is still time. Should this effort prove successful through a culmination of partnerships with researchers and close collaboration with the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service the results could be far reaching beyond park boundaries and set the course for reintroductions and ercovery range-wide. ,2018,2023

The conceptual basis of the research proposed here is to develop insight into the relationship between bacterial diversity and biogeochemical processes by exploring the mechanistic basis of ecological succession in a natural bacterioplankton community. This study will build on the doctoral candidate’s previous dissertation work demonstrating how predictable bacterioplankton succession in high-elevation lakes is linked to landscape-scale snowmelt-driven changes in the composition and source of dissolved organic matter. Here we aim to illustrate how specific taxa within the pelagic bacterial community respond to changes in the rate and character of inputs of catchment-derived dissolved organic matter and bacteria in order to understand the landscape drivers of bacterioplankton succession. First the exact taxonomic identity of predefined successional communities will be defined via nucleic acid cloning, permitting modeling of the rates and vectors of change of specific taxa in relation to observed temporal shifts in specific organic compounds. Factorial experimental manipulation of organic matter sources and bacterioplankton community types within in situ mesocosm growth cultures will determine how changes in taxonomic composition are coupled to the metabolism of specific dissolved organic compounds. Finally, using quantitative-PCR, the role of inflowing catchment-derived bacterial taxa in the successional progression will be examined under various hydrological regimes, providing insight into the rates of assembly of microbial communities. Together the results of these studies will be analyzed to determine how taxonomic composition in bacterial communities is linked to the metabolism of specific dissolved organic compounds, and how ecological theories of community assembly, succession, and ecosystem metabolism may be applied to explaining microbial diversity in time and space.",2007,2009

Dynamical consequences of these phenomena include perturbation of the chemical and biological environment that can dramatically impact biogeochemical cycling in the ocean. The processes that regulate this response are extraordinarily complex, challenging us to understand how the physical, biological and chemical processes are functionally related. Recent evidence suggests that mesoscale eddies are an important nutrient transport mechanism in the oligotrophic waters of the main subtropical gyres. Numerical simulations and satellite based statistical estimates indicate that the magnitude of the eddy-driven nutrient flux could be sufficient to balance geochemical estimates of new production, which far exceed that which can be sustained by traditional mechanisms of nutrient supply. Relatively few direct observations of this process are available, owing to the spatial and temporal intermittency of the events which drive it. Available data demonstrate that isopycnal displacements associated with certain types of eddies can transport nutrients into the euphotic zone, resulting in the accumulation of chlorophyll 182 in the overlying waters. However, the nature of the biological response and its impact on coupled biogeochemical cycles and export has yet to be elucidated. Furthermore, the relationship between eddy-induced upwelling and diapycnal mixing in and below the mixed layer remains obscure; the strength of this interaction determines the degree to which the eddy-driven effects are irreversible and thereby effect a net biogeochemical flux. Our team of investigators proposes to collect a set of measurements that will document phytoplankton physiological response, changes in community structure, export and the biogeochemical ramifications of eddy induced upwelling and mixing in the Sargasso Sea. Target features will be identified prior to field deployment via remote sensing. High resolution surveys will be undertaken with an undulating towed instrument that includes a Video Plankton Recorder and a Fast Repetition Rate Fluorometer. This suite of instruments will facilitate simultaneous assessment of photosynthetic parameters and the species assemblage of phytoplankton and zooplankton. These measurements will be accompanied by discrete water sampling of biogeochemical properties in sets of stations along cross sections of the chosen features. Export will be measured at selected locations within the mesoscale structure. Rates of mixing between the surface mixed layer (order 10m) and waters at the base of the euphotic zone (order 100m) will be inferred from the Helium flux gauge and measured directly with an SF6 tracer release. Taken together, these observations will be sufficient to test the hypothesis that eddy-induced upwelling increases photosynthetic rates, changes community structure and increases export from the euphotic zone, thereby playing an important role in biogeochemical cycling of the subtropical oceans. In essence, what is suggested herein is a mechanism by which a highly nonlinear biological response regulates the impact of a physical disturbance on biogeochemical cycling. We plan to incorporate what we learn about the nature of this regulation into basin-scale eddy-resolving models of the North Atlantic in order to investigate the impacts of this coupled physical/biological/chemical dynamic on large-scale biogeochemical distributions. We hypothesize that geophysical turbulence causes a net acceleration of elemental cycling that plays a fundamental role in maintaining the mean biogeochemical state of the ocean. The proposed research is to be carried out in a collaborative effort amongst ten principal investigators from five institutions: Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, the Bermuda Biological Station for Research, Rutgers University, University of California, Santa Barbara, and the University of Miami. The work consists of two years of field observations followed by a final year of synthesis.",2003,2009

Water resources in the region are already limited and are expected to become more so in coming decades. Higher air temperatures associated with climatic change will likely lead to reduced snow accumulation and melt, reducing summer streamflows. Understanding how large watersheds that are of mixed geologic composition with a range of snow accumulation and melt characteristics may respond to climatic change is an important step in analyzing regional responses to climatic change. Predicting spatial patterns of streamflow sensitivity associated with snowpack change is complicated by the influence of geology on the rate at which recharge (snowmelt or rain) becomes streamflow. Within the Oregon Cascades, distinct geologic differences between the younger High Cascade province and the older Western Cascade province are dominant controls on drainage rates and ultimately streamflow. The methods used in this study will include process-based hydrologic modeling (RHESSys) to predict distributed streamflow sensitivity to climatic change within the McKenzie River basin, a major Willamette River tributary. Fieldwork will monitor streamflow and produce a framework to distribute model parameters. Streamflow predictions will be integrated with reservoir models to assess the sensitivity to potential climatic change for three large reservoirs in the McKenzie watershed. The objective of this study is to provide a better understanding of the interaction among the controls of snowpack and geology on streamflow at multiple scales and its response to climatic change in the Oregon Cascades. This study is designed to advance our understanding and ability to model the complex interactions among climate, geology and streamflow in heteorogenous snow dominated mountain landscapes. This study explicitly addresses spatial heteorogenity and the associated challenges in applying hydrologic models. In particular, this study develops and assesses a geologic-based strategy for model parameterization. This approach will contribute to the ongoing hydrologic research initiative Predictions in Ungaged Basins (PUB) that is of considerable interest to the larger hydrologic community. This study will perform multi-criteria, and multi-scale evaluation of a hydrologic model, RHESSys, using both comparisons with multiple stream gauges and remote sensing of spatial patterns of snow cover. Study results will also integrate modeling of natural controls on climate-streamflow interactions with reservoir management models, which place streamflow results in a practical context. This research complements ongoing larger research initiatives designed to characterize the spatial structure of climatic change impacts on water resources within the western US mountains. This research will complement the PI’s previous work in this study area that has included fieldwork, empirical analyses, and hydrologic modeling.",2007,2009

Along the U.S. West Coast, nearly all waters deeper than 20 fathoms (~36 m) are closed to all bottom fishing to protect several species of rockfish from local extinction. Similar, though actually unrelated, management actions have created no-take marine reserves around the northern Channel Islands as a means of protecting biodiversity and fish abundances. The phrase ""the oceans are in crisis"" once used only by is now being used with increasing regularity by fishery managers and fishers themselves. The decline of fisheries and ecological diversity of nearshore waters is driving the ""crisis-mode"" nature by which nearshore fish resources are presently being managed. Clearly, it is time to examine the complexity of nearshore communities and the fisheries that depend upon 183 them. Nearshore fisheries couple natural (ecological) and human (fishery management) processes resulting in an emergent dynamic system, rich in complexity. The goal of this proposal is to develop a process-level description of nearshore fisheries and their management patterned after California coastal environments. Specifically, we propose to examine the emergent complexity that arises due to interactions among chaotic coastal circulations, fished organism life cycles, the productivity and suitability of nearshore habitats, the intensity and nature of fish harvesting, the economics governing fisheries, fishers and fishery regulations and the bureaucratic system which implements regulations. Our aim is to assess the balance points among costs, profits, uncertainties, stock viability and ecological values of nearshore fished environments. Central to developing a predictive understanding of the interactions between flow, fish and fishing (F3) is the notion of time/space scales. The physics, biology, and socio-economic processes governing this coupled natural/human system operate on inherently different spatial and temporal scales. Without considering the mismatch in scales explicitly, mismanagement of fisheries is likely to continue unabated. Fortunately, the components of a solution to this problem are at hand. Recent advances in modeling coastal ocean circulations, marine life cycle dynamics, the values of information to fishery management, and the consequences of management choices in the face of uncertainty have independently created the pieces necessary to assemble a synthetic approach to nearshore fisheries management. Moreover, large-scale programs monitoring the dynamics of coastal ecosystems are finally providing the empirical data necessary to parameterize and test these models. The individual investigators in this project are leaders in these component efforts. Collectively, they will link these components into new computational and conceptual models that examine optimal management choices in the face of unavoidable physical and biological uncertainty. Although this project uses the Southern California Bight as a focal ecosystem, the issues addressed and conceptual frameworks that arise will have broader, global impacts. Declines in fish stocks and yields are not restricted to any nation or biogeographical region. Indeed, the core problems from mismatches in spatial and temporal scales are characteristic of nearly all marine fisheries. In addition, although fisheries management commonly stops at political borders, ocean flows and fish do not. The ecological scales of coastal ecosystems are inherently international in scope. The international partnerships between this proposed effort and ongoing ecological programs in Mexico, Chile, New Zealand and Australia will expand the regional focus of this effort to global dimensions. Finally, this project links efforts by physical, natural and social scientists in a system where understanding all three components and, more importantly, their interactions are critical to success. The interdisciplinarity of the effort is not just buzzword. Approaches that do not link across these disciplines are doomed to fail. Hence, this project has rich educational opportunities across a range of ages. Since most have at one time been a part of a fishery, either as a harvester or a consumer, the key issues should be appreciated at their core by nearly everyone. This program integrates several opportunities for interdisciplinary education from K-12, through undergraduate, graduate and adult programs.",2003,2009

Carter Ohlmann Libe Washburn,3/1/04,8/31/09,459874,National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,OCE-0352187,Collaborative Research: Stochastic Transport Models for the Coastal Ocean,"This research seeks to determine optimal stochastic particle transport (i.e. Lagrangian) models for use in the coastal ocean. Circulation observations for the coastal ocean exist primarily in the form of time-averaged Eulerian fields. Many applied problems in coastal oceanography are concerned 150 with how things are transported and where they go. Accurate Lagrangian stochastic transport models for the near-shore region are a necessary link between the copious Eulerian coastal circulation data from high frequency (HF) radar systems, and transport information required by coastal resource managers tasked with identifying the fate of pollutants, larvae, and objects lost- at-sea. Specific research objectives are to: 1. Observe surface flow fields in two coastal regions using HF radar and high-resolution drifters; 2. Develop accurate Lagrangian transport models to predict trajectories from the HF radar fields; 3. Model trajectories and quantify their skill through comparisons with in-situ drifter tracks; and 4. Compute redistribution kernel functions (RKFs), or connectivity matrices, and demonstrate their utility as simple probabilistic near-shore transport models. Existing trajectory models will be modified for consideration of flow patterns characteristic to the coastal ocean. A model with a large-scale mean component (U), a periodic component representing tidal and (near-) inertial motions (Up), and a Lagrangian stochastic component (model; LSM) for subgrid-scale motions (u) will be developed. The LSM will initially be based on high resolution drifter data. An LSM parameterization based on large-scale velocity information (e.g. integral time scales, eddy variance.) and coastal geomorphology will then be developed. This enables the trajectory models to be applied in all coastal regions with sufficient large-scale flow information. Model skill over a wide range of dynamic parameters (e.g. velocity, vorticity, eddy energy) will be quantified in the Santa Barbara (CA) and Miami (FL) coastal regions through comparisons with in-situ drifter tracks. RKFs, giving the probability that a particle released at some location x0 at time t0 will reach location x1 at t1, will be computed with modeled trajectories and evaluated as tools for predicting transport, or connectivity in the coastal ocean. An improved understanding of coastal circulation will result from subsequent identification of how and why RKFs vary spatially and temporally.",2004,2009

Results of these experiments will comprise a major advance in our understanding of fluid processes within oceanic crust and will develop new tools and methods that can be applied in many settings. An earlier grant funded engineering design and testing in preparation for these experiments; the current proposal requests science support. Proposed experiments will begin during an expedition of the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) currently scheduled for Summer 2008 and will extend four years beyond the drilling expedition. Funds requested will support construction of scientific instrumentation; emplacement recovery and replacement of long-term instruments by submersible or ROV; collection of seafloor and subseafloor data and samples from observatory systems; analysis of data and samples; numerical modeling of coupled fluid-heat-solute transport using conditional simulation; training of students; and presentation and publication of results. Large-scale long-term experiments will be run using a network of six subseafloor observatories on the eastern flank of the Juan de Fuca Ridge. This is an ideal place for this work based on earlier drilling experience available infrastructure extensive site surveys and a broad understanding of crustal properties and fluid flow patterns. Three borehole observatories were installed as part of IODP Expedition 301 (Summer 2004) and three additional observatories will be installed in Summer 2008. Specific questions to be addressed include: (1) What is the nature (magnitude distribution) of permeability in upper oceanic crust? (2) What are the magnitudes and directions of driving forces fluid fluxes and associated solute and heat transport? (3) What are the magnitude and nature of storage properties including pressure- temporal- and spatial- dependence? (4) What are relations between fluid flow vertical and horizontal compartmentalization transport and distribution of microorganisms alteration structure and primary crustal lithology? (5) How large are fluid reservoirs what are fluid residence times and velocities and how do these respond to perturbations (controlled pumping tides seismic events)? During the 2008 drilling expedition an existing borehole observatory will be replaced and two new observatories will be installed all monitoring multiple crustal levels. Observatories will include the latest generations of pressure instrumentation continuous fluid sampling systems microbial colonization substrate and autonomous temperature logging instruments within the sealed holes. We will run a 24-hour fluid injection experiment in one borehole during drilling and monitor formation response in five other holes 35 m - 2400 m away. We will inject a mixture of tracers to be used in single-hole and cross-hole transport studies. After one-two years of borehole equilibration following drilling we will use the natural formation overpressure to run a free-flow aquifer test for 1-2 years allowing us to quantify crustal hydrogeologic properties at enormous spatial scales and to sample and analyze formation fluids and microbes.,2007,2009

Nor to the best of our knowledge does an integrated data location and access capability exist outside of the Earth sciences for highly distributed heavily populated systems of data products based on voluntary participation. To address this problem we propose integrating the Alexandria Digital Library (ADL) the world‚Äôs leading digital library for geospatial and georeferenced information with OPeNDAP. Together these technologies will allow a distributed network of independent information providers to support a single uniform interface for information discovery evaluation verification and retrieval.

A whole soil perspective is important: 1) while surface soils are more active per gram the massive deeper horizons contribute significantly to overall soil activity and 2) there are strong gradients of resource availability and stress through the soil profile. Understanding how interactive effects of resource and stress on soil microbes is key to understanding all microbial life in soil. Our research to date has addressed microbial diversity and function through the profile by evaluating whether the hypothesis from macroecology that diversity should be greatest at intermediate levels of resource availability and/or disturbance‚Äù applies in soil microbial ecology. This project will evaluate how resource availability and stress regulate microbial communities populations and functional groups through the profile. We will experimentally manipulate resource and stress regimes and evaluate microbial responses. Specific populations to study will be either characteristic of particular environments in the soil (i.e surface or deep) or particularly sensitive to environmental variation. Examples we have identified so far include Variovorax (a ‚Äúvadose zone specialist‚Äù) several pseudomonads an unusually high GC gram positive and Streptomyces lividans. The project will use terminally labeled restriction fragment length polymorphisms (T-RFLPs) to evaluate community-level diversity and composition. A combination of quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) and probing using group-level primers and probes will be used to quantitatively analyze microbial communities at a range of taxonomic levels. Specific probes based on sequences of keystone clones that are found to be most responsive to imposed stress and resource conditions will be used to analyze individual populations and how they respond to the interactions of stress and varying resource availability. We will analyze microbial function and specific substrate use by tracing 13C flow from labeled compounds (monomers and polymers) into different forms including individual CO2 microbial PLFAs and specific extracellular polysaccharides.,2005,2010
167p,Jeff Dozier,4/1/06,3/31/10,150000,National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,EAR-0537327,Sintering in Snow and the Possible Role of Soluble Impurities,We examined well-sintered mid-winter snow from Mammoth Mountain California using an environmental scanning electron microscope equipped with cold stage. Ring-like filaments were observed at all grain boundaries in a highly sublimated sputter-coated sample two days after collection through filaments were much harder to find in uncoated samples. Filaments appeared in uncoated specimens from the same snow sample five months later through x-ray microanalysis failed to detect soluble impurities in the filaments grain boundary grooves or on ice grain surfaces above background noise levels. After eight months in storage and under forced sublimation in high vacuum the same sample produced not only grain boundary filaments but complex web-like structures nodules and films that in extreme cases formed castings of completely sublimated snow grains. Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry reveals that the filaments and webs are composed of the same set of light elements typical of the solible impurities in Sierra snow. The spectra also reveal significant spatial variability in element ratios. Impurities probably concentrate in a quasi-liquid layer at the air/ice interface and in the disordered grain boundary region where crystal lattices are disoriented. If concentrated at grain boundaries these light elements could act as dopants reducing grain boundary energy reducing melting temperatures and promoting the sintering process.,2006,2010

Light absorption by CDOM drives photochemical reactions and its light absorption often obscures our ability to diagnose biogeochemical processes from satellite ocean color imagery. CDOM is an optical property; hence, its concentration can be quantified synoptically over large spatial scales using satellite sensors or in situ from a host of autonomous platforms. Although land-ocean exchanges are well known sources of ocean CDOM, recent observations have shown that open ocean CDOM is created through in situ biogeochemical processes. Despite the importance of CDOM to ocean biogeochemistry, little is known about the chemical nature of CDOM in the open ocean in relation to its global distribution. In this continuation work, we will take the next step towards the first systematic global survey of CDOM in the world ocean and to use these observations in conjunction with data from the CLIVAR-Repeat Hydrography program to characterize CDOM and DOM in the open ocean. Specifically, we will: • Continue our global surveying of CDOM and DOM quality indices on CLIVAR- Repeat Hydrography cruises in the Pacific, Southern and Indian Ocean • Assess the connections among global CDOM stocks and its diagenetic state as measured using amino acid content and spectrofluorometric analysis (using newly collected and archived samples from the previous period of performance), • Develop and test our predictive understanding of the open ocean CDOM cycle through data analyses and numerical modeling. It is through our continued coupled investigation of CDOM stocks, chemical and spectral characterization, and analysis and modeling that we hope to synthesize a new understanding of its sources, sinks and distributions within the global oceans. CDOM characterization will also give us a new dimension with which to assess the changes in chemical nature and lability of DOM as it cycles through the global ocean.",2007,2010
169p,Brad Hacker,6/1/08,5/31/10,141339,National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,742451,Collaborative Research: Element Recycling from UHP Metasediments: Evidence and Consequences,We propose a study of ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) metasediments that have been subducted to >75 km to determine whether these rocks lost key trace elements during dehydration and/or melt extraction. Understanding the fluxes of material into and out of subduction zones is fundamental to understanding global geochemistry and a central goal of the MARGINS Initiative. Recycling efficiency (melt flux into arc crust/sediment flux into subduction zones) is as high as 75‚Äì80% for Th and > 30% for Ba and Be in the Central American arc for example [Plank et al. 2002; Morris and Ryan 2003]. In this study we will quantify processes that are responsible for this recycling. A commonly invoked hypothesis is that recycled Th Be and light rare-earth elements (LREE) from subducting sediments are transported into the mantle source of arc magmas in a melt because fluids below the aqueous fluid-saturated solidus contain negligible concentrations of Th Be and LREE. During the past five years >100 Fall AGU abstracts and >100 peer-reviewed papers have invoked a hypothetical sediment-melt component in arc magmas. Despite the importance of this hypothesis the residues of Th Be and LREE recycling from subducting metasediments have not been observed. It is by no means clear whether the melt-recycling hypothesis is correct and ‚Äì if it is ‚Äì under what PT conditions this happens. How does recycling occur beneath Central America? Natural rocks that have undergone subduction-zone metamorphism may record open-system fractional-dehydration and/or fractional-melting processes that are all but impossible to duplicate in the lab. In addition natural rocks have undergone modification at geological rates whereas it is difficult to extrapolate reaction kinetics from experimental conditions. We will focus on subducted metasedimentary rocks with the highest recorded pressures. These so-called ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) rocks reached pressures > 2 GPa. Most UHP rocks fall squarely within the bounds established by modern thermal models for ‚Äústeady state‚Äù subduction of oceanic crust and marine sediment in island arcs but we will also study samples that reached higher temperatures. To study UHP metasedimentary samples we will (1) use a consistent set of metamorphic reactions with mineral compositions from the literature and new analyses (2) collect new data for trace-element and isotope exchange thermometers and (3) use major-element oxygen isotope and geological field relations to identify metasediments. We will (4) measure trace elements in selected metasediments and compare them to the composition of fine-grained sedimentary rocks to identify systematic changes associated with melt extraction or dehydration. To interpret these changes and predict additional changes that could have occurred if our samples were carried to higher pressure and/or temperature we will (5) analyze trace elements in minerals in UHP samples ‚Äì to quantify mineral‚Äìmineral partitioning. Our study will yield vital constraints on the budget of key elements in subducting metasediments and the extraction of these elements via fluid and melt transport into the zone of magma genesis beneath arcs. For example a key outcome of this research might be confirmation that Th and Be are mainly retained in UHP metasediments up to the breakdown of minor phases such as zircon and allanite during melting.,2008,2010
170p,Cathy Busby,7/1/07,6/30/10,206678,National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,711276,Collaborative Research: Origin and Significance of High Potassium Volcanism: Insights from the Ancestral Cascades California,Although high K2O volcanism has been investigated for decades its origin remains unclear. Our preliminary field and geochemical data show that the ancestral Cascades arc in the central Sierra Nevada and eastern California is the ideal place to study the significance of K2O in regard to arc- related magmatism and the respective roles of the lithosphere and asthenosphere in generating continental volcanics. The medium to high-K eruptive products in the central Sierra are distinctive and widespread and are underlain and overlain by mappable and dateable andesite units enabling us to correlate changes in magmatism with other events such as faulting uplift or changes in volcanic styles. The exposures are superior with erosion to a level that is ideal for defining extrusive-intrusive suites and the rocks are relatively pristine. Best of all basalt lava flows are present at all stratigraphic levels allowing us to evaluate temporal changes in magma evolution and mantle sources. Despite these advantages most of these rocks remain unmapped and undated. Yet the central Sierra Nevada forms the core of two large NSF projects the Sierra Nevada EarthScope and Sierra Drips Continental Dynamics projects which seek to determine if lithosphere delamination occurred in the northern and central Sierra and what its effects might be on volcanic activity. The work proposed here will provide an important and much-needed geologic and geochronologic framework for petrologic study of high- K rocks of the ancestral Cascades arc. We will test three petrologic-tectonic models for high K2O volcanism: 1) Many workers have proposed that high-K volcanism is a signal of lithosphere delamination. But observations in the southern Sierra Nevada present a problem. With removal of the lithosphere delamination should yield basalts that show a shift towards more depleted asthenosphere-like isotope ratios. Instead in the southern Sierra high-K volcanic rocks have low 143Nd/144Nd and high La/Nb ratios which prior work shows are indicative of a mantle lithosphere source. The central Sierra Nevada provides an independent test of the delamination-high K2O link. 2) As subduction ceases fluid inputs from the slab should decrease along with ratios that are indicative of a slab component such as Sr/P and Ba/Nb. It has been proposed that high K2O contents in the southern Sierra Nevada show a subduction- related component and hence may reflect an arc-post arc transition through passage of the Mendocino triple junction. If so trace element ratios that reflect slab- derived inputs elsewhere in the Sierra Nevada (e.g. Sr/P Ba/Nb) should decrease across the MTJ transition and correlate with K2O. 3) A third possibility for the origin of high K2O volcanism is that they derive from deep-seated fractional crystallization of a clinopyroxene-dominated mineral assemblage. Experimental data and our preliminary petrographic results suggest that this model is viable i.e. that a southward increase in crustal thickness in the Sierra Nevada yields a southward increase in depths of magma stagnation (greater clinopyroxene fractionation) and by consequence increased K2O values. We propose to test this last model using clinopyroxene thermobarometers which are predicted to yield progressively greater crystallization depths to the south. These three models are all clearly testable the results of which will greatly enhance our understanding of the proper interpretation of the geochemical signals provided by volcanic rocks.,2007,2010

The spatial distribution of hydraulic mining sediment reworking and deposition in flood bypasses over the last century are relevant to the fate of contaminants, flood conveyance, and the land-use in the lower Sacramento Valley of California, which is undergoing a massive program of restoration and development, and to basic research on valley floor sediment budgets and floodplain sedimentation. This research employs a suite of new techniques and data to investigate the temporal and spatial links between Central Valley floodplain sedimentation and erosion of hydraulic mining sediment in the Sierra piedmont over the last century. Recent field evidence of episodic piedmont erosion and bypass deposition calls for a new investigation of the hydraulic mining sediment delivery problem in the lower Sacramento valley over the last century. The research will track the movement of fine sediments derived from hydraulic mining tailings in the lower Sacramento Valley. The research team will link spatial and temporal patterns and processes of deposition in Sutter and Yolo Bypasses (leveed floodplains of the Central Valley) with erosion of piedmont tailings of the lower Bear, Yuba, and Feather Rivers downstream of the last major dam on each. It will track historical erosion of hydraulic mining sediments in the piedmont through a combination of 190 photogrammetry, channel change analysis, and field surveys. The team will document history and provenance of mining sediment deposits in the Central Valley by granulometry, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, magnetism, and geochronology. In addition, records from a network of streamflow gauging stations will be perused for corroborative analysis of temporal correlation between piedmont erosion and Central Valley sedimentation. The project will produce quantitative, field-based estimates of volumetric sediment storage and erosion along piedmont channels and the timing of its evacuation. It will document geochemical, grain size, and magnetic properties of mining and non-mining sediment and develop appropriate mixing models for discerning the relative influence of each source downstream through the fluvial system. It will identify the spatial extent and volume of discrete sediment deposits in the bypass system, and document sedimentation rates and histories along various transects spanning Sutter and Yolo Bypasses. The research will develop quantitative links between piedmont erosion and bypass deposition that are based on historical hydrology and refined conceptual models of bypass sedimentation processes. It will provide the basis for predictive modeling of the impact of future floods on sediment movement through the Central Valley. The project will provide a quantitative basis for future management decisions and direction in the Sacramento Valley and a set of methodologies that can be applied to other large, managed river basins. Data and interpretations from this study will be of great practical use to river and environmental management in the lower Sacramento Valley and the Delta, where our results are of utmost importance to flood conveyance, maintenance of islands, and potential toxicity of sediment. This research will create educational opportunities for a new generation of geomorphologists, including those from historically underrepresented groups. The output from this research will be made available as a project website via the World Wide Web and provide direct K-12 scientific outreach through the NASA space consortium, an educator resource center.",2005,2010
172p,David Siegel,9/15/06,8/31/10,199410,National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,628389,Collaborative Research: Carbon Flux through the twilight zone - new tools to measure change,"Changes in the distribution of carbon within the ocean are caused by a combination of physicochemical and biological processes. The first of these two, the so-called “solubility pump”, injects carbon into the deep sea through the sinking of cold waters at high latitudes where CO2 solubility is enhanced (Feely et al., 2001; Sabine et al., 2004). The so-called oceanic “biological pump” is highly dynamic and variable in space and time. This process operates through the production of organic carbon by organisms in the surface ocean and the subsequent sequestration of this material below the winter mixed layer (Volk and Hoffert, 1985). Significant effort has gone into understanding the controls of the biological pump and while the general function is understood, the details remain elusive. At present, we know much more about processes in the surface euphotic zone, than in the Twilight Zone (i.e. mesopelagic). It is within the poorly understood Twilight Zone where changes in C attenuation on sinking particles and the composition of sinking material have important consequences for the rates of C uptake and exchange at the surface ocean with the atmosphere, and for longer term C sequestration in the deep sea. This proposal sets out to develop improved particle flux collectors and use these to answer key science questions associated with C fluxes and exchange via sinking particles at the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) site (e.g. Michaels and Knap, 1996). Currently at BATS, we can’t balance surface ocean C budgets, annual new production estimates, or link production and community structure to predict particle export, and regularly fail to capture episodic flux events. At the same time, we are trying to answer these questions using an imperfect tool, the drifting sediment trap, a device that has served us well but has not changed significantly since the early 1980’s. 180 This program is both innovative and ambitious, with the development and engineering of new tools and its emphasis on the collection of multi-annual time-series data, while being realistic in starting from proven technology. We start by building upon our recent success with the neutrally buoyant sediment trap (NBST), but recognize that continuous flux collection and swimmer free samples are needed, as envisioned for our new design- the Twilight Zone EXplorer (TZEX). In context of the C and Water in the Earth System Program, this proposal advances our understanding of the carbon cycle by combining the following multidisciplinary elements: • basic research in ocean biology obtained from ship based observations and remote sensing • geochemistry of particles and waters and how these change with depth and time • modeling of biological processes and particle transport in moving fluids • the engineering and application of novel observational equipment to capture sinking particles These unique sediment trap devices will open up a new window to assess the ocean’s role as a C sink and how marine export production will change in response to climate change (Bopp et al., 2001, 2005). This study provides parallel science and engineering opportunities over longer time- series which are difficult to support in core programs, but are essential if we are to make a major improvement in our understanding of ocean C fluxes. The UCSB group proposes to conduct a combination of remote sensing, numerical modeling and data analysis tasks to assess the role of time/space variability of export around the trap deployments on the monthly inferences of C export. During the time series operations, the UCSB group will help in at-field sampling by forecasting where the deployed TZEX and NBST traps will go and where did they collect sinking particles (as we did in VERTIGO). This requires some at-sea work measuring and analyzing currents from the R/V Ocean Explorer’s ADCP system and combining them with satellite altimetry maps of surface currents. This will require UCSB staff (Fields and Siegel) to go to Bermuda many times during this grant period. We will also assess the sampling scales of the NBST and tethered traps deployed here and will analyze available merged ocean color imagery to assess the time/space variability of Chl and NPP surrounding each trap deployment enabling us to assess the importance of episodic blooms.

173p,Brad Hacker,1/1/06,12/31/10,138744,National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,EAR-0545399,Collaborative Research: Earthscope intergrated investigation of Cascadia subduction zone tremor structure and process,We propose an integrated Earthscope field experiment in the Cascadia subduction zone to elucidate the relationship between water transport aseismic slip episodic tremor and arc magmatism. Globally Cascadia represents an end-member of subduction in that some of the youngest and warmest lithosphere on Earth is being subducted leading to predictions that the downgoing plate is dehydrating at unusually shallow depth. Nevertheless a volcanic arc exists with abundant H2O in some magmas indicating that there must exist pathways by which H2O travels through the entire subduction system. Our ultimate aim is to explore the processing of H2O in subduction zones using the tools of seismology geodesy and petrology and to integrate these results with complementary constraints from geodynamics and geochemistry. Seismic imaging will illuminate the descending oceanic plate where it metamorphoses and illuminate the mantle wedge where fluids may be producing hydrous phases such as serpentine or beneath the volcanic arc primary magmas. We design our experiment to traverse the one part of the Cascadia system where earthquakes extend to nearly 100 km depth so we can investigate the relationship between the release of fluids and the generation of Benioff-zone earthquakes. The transport of fluids may be also a primary driver for episodic tremor and slip (ETS) a phenomenon observed in Cascadia perhaps better than anywhere else on the planet. We will integrate measurements of tremor from known source regions with slip distributions derived from GPS data and existing long-baseline tiltmeters. Together with the proposed seismic imaging these observations will yield an unparalleled data set for determining the relationship between tremor slip and the regions where imaging indicates metamorphism of the down-going plate or hydration of the overlying mantle wedge. The basic experiment has four components: a broadband imaging array of flexible-array instruments integrated with Bigfoot three small-aperture seismic arrays near sources of non- volcanic tremor analysis of the PBO and PANGA GPS data sets to define the details of episodic slip events and integrative modeling. The broadband array features a dense transect across the part of the Cascadia subduction system that includes intermediate-depth earthquakes and the Nisqually earthquake hypocenter in a staggered configuration to allow along-strike effects to be tested. That will be complemented by 2 cross lines one crossing the slab where the crust appears to be dehydrating and one in the Cascades foothills to sample the roots of the arc. The tremor and GPS arrays are collocated with the broadband imaging as much as possible to allow simultaneous location of tremor and slip and imaging of their source region. These data will be subject to the gamut of analyses appropriate to such data including array analysis for wave-front orientation of tremor waves migration of teleseismic scattered waves tomographic images of Vp Vs and Q shear-wave splitting earthquake relocation investigation of high-frequency phases interacting with the slab and specialized GPS processing designed for the detection and quantification of transient events. The interpretations will be made in conjunction with detailed petrological‚Äì thermal models of the Cascadia subduction system. These results will place new constraints on the dehydration pathways within the down-going plate the relationship between structure and seismicity at intermediate depths the relationship between transient strain events and structure the temperature melt and volatile content of the mantle wedge and the growth of continental crust.,2006,2010

This work will profoundly improve our understanding of fluid processes within oceanic crust and will develop new tools and methods that can be applied in many settings. The project includes engineering design and testing system construction and observatory servicing and will support long-term experiments initiated during drilling and by ROV/HOV. Experiments will be run using a network of six subseafloor observatories installed in basement holes on the eastern flank of the Juan de Fuca Ridge. This is an ideal place for this work based on earlier drilling experience available infrastructure extensive site surveys and a broad understanding of crustal properties and fluid flow patterns. IODP Expedition 301 (summer 2004) installed three new observatories. A second drilling expedition is waiting to be scheduled by the Operations Committee (OPCOM) with the next opportunity anticipated in 2007/08. This NSF proposal is for: CORK and scientific system design and testing; construction of drillship seafloor subseafloor and ROV/HOV instrumentation; emplacement recovery and replacement of long- term instruments; collection of data and samples from these systems; analysis of data and samples; training of students; and presentation and publication of results. During the next drilling expedition an existing borehole observatory will be replaced and two new observatories will be installed all monitoring multiple crustal levels. Observatories will include the latest generations of pressure instrumentation continuous fluid sampling systems microbial colonization substrate and autonomous temperature logging instruments within the sealed holes. We will run a 24-hour fluid injection experiment in one borehole during drilling and monitor formation response in five other holes 35 m - 2400 m away. We will also inject a mixture of tracers to be used in single-hole and cross-hole transport studies. After one-two years of borehole equilibration following drilling we will use the natural formation overpressure to run a free-flow (""artesian"") aquifer test for two years allowing us to quantify crustal hydrogeologic properties at enormous spatial scales and sample formation fluids and microbes.",2006,2011

Aquatic ecosystems integrate environmental conditions and can provide indications of how montane regions are responding to warming climate, changing snow regime and altered atmospheric deposition. Recent evidence indicates that aquatic ecosystems of the Sierra Nevada, while remote from development, are undergoing eutrophication from increased loading of nutrients. Consequently, our focus has been to asses the responses of productivity to changing inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus and to evaluate the coupling between climate variability and N and P biogeochemistry. We use a multi-faceted approach to achieve our goals. We combine long term high resolution measurements of Emerald Lake and neighboring lakes with periodic regional sampling throughout the Sierra Nevada. We have used this approach successfully with regard to acidic deposition, nitrogen balance, nutrient limitation and bacterial community composition (Melack and Stoddard 1991, Sickman et al. 2001, Sickman et al. 2002, Sickman et al. 2003, Nelson et al. in press). 139 As part of combined LTREB research and the dissertation studies of Steve Sadro, we have been measuring lake metabolism in Emerald Lake. Specifically, we have been evaluating spatial and temporal variability in lake metabolism and how overall metabolic balance is affected by different environmental drivers. This research integrates our understanding of nutrient loading and catchment processes as they interact with physical conditions in the lake to affect nutrient cycling and overall productivity. For the ice-free season of 2009, we propose to continue measurements at Emerald Lake to characterize physical and biogeochemical seasonal patterns. Water samples will regularly be collected from multiple depths to characterize nutrient and dissolved organic matter dynamics. In addition, we will deploy thermistor chains to characterize mixing dynamics. Similarly, optical oxygen sensors will be deployed and combined with periodic diel oxygen profiles to characterize lake metabolism and calculate productivity. We will also periodically use benthic incubation chambers to isolate benthic metabolic rates and to quantify rates of phosphorus exchange with the sediments. From mid-August to mid-September, during the period when Sierran lakes are most stratified, we will conduct a regional survey of lakes. We know from previous surveys that nutrient and dissolved organic matter concentrations, two important drivers of metabolic rates, vary in relation to lake position within a catchment. Lakes located high in a catchment, where there are few or no upstream lakes and where there is little vegetation, tend to have higher concentrations of inorganic nutrients and lower concentrations of dissolved organic matter than lakes lower in a catchment. While lake position in the landscape may influence some environmental drivers of metabolism, it remains unclear if natural gradients of these drivers will result in differences in metabolic balance between lakes. Our multi-lake survey will enable us to explore these relationships and place the temporal patterns found at Emerald Lake in a regional context.",2007,2011
177p,Chris Sorlien,1/1/08,2/28/11,62050,National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,739745,Seismic Stratigraphic Correlations Across Ross Sea for ROSSMAP: Paleoclimate and Tectonics,"Existing publications propose early Miocene-Oligocene glaciation of Central High paleo-islands and of a basin adjacent to Marie Byrd Land. Was the imaged erosion due to Piedmont glaciers, or did ice sheets scour the full 300 km width of Eastern Basin? We use seismic reflection profiles, correlated to Deep Sea Drilling Program (DSDP) sites 270 and 272, to interpret the stratigraphy of Eastern Basin. Evidence for early Miocene-Oligocene glacial erosion of the basin flanks include 100 m-high mounds or ridges on a pre-25 Ma unconformity and multiple scour surfaces with grooves interpreted as glacial megaflutes. Near the present ice shelf edge, a ~25 Ma unconformity cuts through a stack of unconformities bounding acoustically transparent rocks. The youngest, most profound unconformity cuts more deeply towards the center of the basin (east). Increasing water depths at Site 270 to hundreds of meters, and basinward-fanning of dips suggest thick ice was required for grounding, consistent with ice sheets sourced from West Antarctica rather than glaciers flowing off Central High islands. Low-resolution profiles best image Oligocene strata in the deep basin center, and cannot resolve features such as glacial flutes. Near the ice shelf edge, the basin fill thins onto Central High by onlap and erosion across a series of unconformities. In contrast, in the east a smooth, planar composite unconformity truncates the entire section, with syn-depositional thinning of ~30% of the 2 km-thick fill. This unconformity is younger than middle Miocene strata sampled near the top of DSDP site 272 and older than the early Pliocene rocks sampled near the bottom of DSDP Site 271. Deep basin strata were denuded by multiple cycles of erosion and isostatic rebound, and are now accessible to shallow shipboard or deeper ANDRILL ice shelf drilling. The same section outcrops on the western flank of Eastern Basin, both beneath the current ice shelf (pre-Miocene), and north of its edge. 193 Ongoing interpretations done after the end of the report period cover most of Ross Sea and provide evidence for the post-early Oligocene subsidence history of wide areas.",2008,2011

The link between predictions from the numerical modeling and the data resulting from real earthquakes must be strengthened. Observations of natural faults and faulting that emerge from geological and seismological studies as well as those from laboratory tests open new questions and point out new challenges. A primary task is to reconcile these observations with physical models of the earthquake source. The purpose of the workshop is to bring together the various researchers from the Americas Asia and Europe who use numerical simulations to investigate dynamics of earthquake ruptures as well as those who have used data to infer the nature of earthquake ruptures. While not mutually exclusive the union of the two sets of investigators is certainly greater than the intersection. A fundamental question that looms over both sets of investigators is what can the data (seismic geodetic geologic laboratory) tell us about the rupture dynamics? Similarly what predictions from different physical descriptions of rupture dynamics are observable?,2010,2011
179p,Daniel Lavallee Ralph Archuleta,7/15/08,6/30/11,250000,National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,738954,Dynamics of Earthquake Rupture on Heterogeneous Faults,The study of the earthquake source has evolved from point sources to kinematic to dynamics as the basic physics of the process has become the focus of source studies. Spatial heterogeneities in the initial stress across the fault surface are critical factors in constraining the dynamics of earthquake rupture and the resulting seismic radiation. Furthermore recent studies have shown that the properties of spatial heterogeneities found in finite-fault source inversions can be captured and modeled with the help of random models. We propose to use this random model to generate statistically credible initial stress spatial distributions that can be used as input to 3D dynamic models for computing scenarios of earthquake ruptures and their radiated field. We use slip distributions from kinematic inversions of data as starting models for the initial stress distribution. Whereas the kinematic inversions have resolution of 1 km or greater the dynamic modeling depends critically on scale lengths of ~100 m. The proposed method ensures that the statistical properties of the initial stress at ~100 m will correspond to the same statistics at ~1 km and vice versa. The scenarios will be used to study the qualitative and quantitative features e.g. local rupture velocity of the rupture dynamics as a function of the random properties of the initial stress. We will also examine the dependence between the random properties of the radiated fields and the random properties of the initial stress. These numerical experiments will be repeated for different friction laws (slip weakening rate-and-state dependent law and the free volume friction law) to assess any dependence between the formulation of the friction law and the expansion of the rupture.,2008,2011

182p,Bruce Kendall,9/15/06,8/31/11,201944,National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,615024,Collaborative Research: Demographic heterogeneity within populations and its consequences,Demographic heterogeneity is likely to be an important determinant of a population‚Äôs dynamics impacting demographic stochasticity low-density growth rate equilibrium density and rate of spatial spread. These are of fundamental ecological importance and may have evolutionary consequences as well; they certainly will influence a population‚Äôs risk of extinction or invasion. However these models are by dint of their simplicity limited in a variety of ways. They are for the most part non-spatial and focus on asymptotic rather than transient dynamics. Where interactions between individuals is included (e.g. density-dependence) it is modeled as a mean-field effect with no consideration of potential variability in local density. Interspecific interactions have not been examined. And finally while many studies have empirically documented heterogeneity of various sorts there has been no integrated assessment of the effects of heterogeneity on the dynamics of an actual population. We propose to extend our understanding of the population impacts of demographic heterogeneity in a variety of ways. Demographic heterogeneity and spatially local interactions: spatial heterogeneity in environmental conditions is an important driver of demographic heterogeneity especially in sessile organisms such as plants. In these species competitive interactions and often dispersal are local and mean field models may be inappropriate. We will use spatially explicit models to analyze the effects of demographic heterogeneity in such populations adding spatial pattern to the endpoints we have already examined in nonspatial models. Demographic heterogeneity and invasion dynamics: our previous work used idealized dispersal kernels and deterministic dynamics but low densities in the leading edge of the invasion front mean that both demography and realized dispersal can be highly stochastic. We will use individual-based spatial models to evaluate how demographic heterogeneity affects the mean and variance of invasion speed. We will also use the model to investigate the conditions required to generate the pattern (observed e.g. in the cane toad invasion) of increasingly strong dispersal ability in the leading edge of the invasion. Demographic heterogeneity and interspecific interactions: we will introduce demographic heterogeneity into models of interacting species (both competitive and consumer- resource interactions) to evaluate how such heterogeneity impacts coexistence criteria and qualitative features of predator-prey cycles. Demographic heterogeneity and the dynamics of a threatened bird species: in collaboration with scientists at the Archbold Biological Station we will use recently developed statistical tools to quantify demographic heterogeneity in a well-studied population of Florida scrub-jays. We will then use our model framework to evaluate how this heterogeneity affects the population dynamics and long-term viability of the population. Insights for metapopulation dynamics: exploiting the qualitative similarity between the density-dependent population model in Stover et al. (2011a) and classic metapopulation models we will develop models that introduce heterogeneity in patch characteristics (extinction and colonization rates). We will investigate whether these models can provide insights into the dynamics of heterogeneous metapopulations that complement or generalize the results of spatially explicit metapopulation models.,2006,2011

In this region of active and rapid continental extension Late Miocene-Pliocene eclogites have been exhumed at cm/yr rates within the lower plates of metamorphic core complexes (MCCs). We propose a 5-year multidisciplinary project to address two key questions in continental dynamics: How does lithosphere rupture? How are HP/UHP terranes formed and exhumed? We will use eastern Papua New Guinea as a field laboratory to examine how the lithosphere has evolved petrologically rheologically and thermally during the transition from subduction to rifting and seafloor spreading. Geologic fieldwork will document the spatial distribution temporal sequence and kinematics of ductile to brittle fabrics in metamorphic magmatic and sedimentary rocks of the conjugate rifted margins the MCCs west of the active seafloor spreading rift tip and the inferred youngest MCC (Dayman Dome). Analytical work will document the pressure-temperature-time deformation n evolution tion of exhumed rocks as well as the melting conditions and sources that have given rise to volcanic rocks. A passive seismic deployment will image the crust and mantle beneath and north of MCCs where partially exhumed HP/UHP rocks may occur at depth. Rock physical properties modeling will integrate petrophysical lab measurements of HP/UHP field samples electron back-scatter diffraction studies of lattice preferred orientations and quantitative mineral-physical-properties calculations for determining seismic wave speeds of rocks. GPS surveys will provide direct measurements of horizontal strain rates associated with HP/UHP exhumation and microplate kinematics. Geodynamic modeling will numerically simulate MCC evolution and exhumation of HP/UHP rocks. All data will be integrated by tectonic synthesis to test end-member models proposed for the tectonic evolution of the region and address the two key questions above. The eastern Papua New Guinea HP/UHP terrane will be compared to similar terranes globally to assess whether exhumation mechanisms documented in this region can be applied to other HP/UHP terranes. Results will contribute to an improved understanding of the processes governing the origin structure composition and dynamic evolution of continental building blocks.

At shallow-levels, recharge, crustal assimilation, and fractional crystallization (RAFC), as well as the temperature-pressure conditions of ascent, and composition(s) of surrounding crust dominate development of compositional diversity. In the mantle, particularly in subduction zones, melts acquire their characteristics from the intricate interplay of source composition (including slab- and sediment-derived fluids, sediments and their associated partial melts), intensive parameter constraints (e.g., P, T, fO2) and the style and extent of melting. Despite much study and hundreds of important contributions on these topics, challenges remain. Among these are quantification of RAFC and partial melting processes using geochemical computational tools now available that simultaneously address major and trace element, phase equilibria, and isotopic constraints, and the testing of quantitative predictions by exploiting advances in laboratory methods for textural and in situ chemical and isotopic analyses of crystals, glass and melt inclusions. We propose to explore these challenges by studying subduction zone volcanism of the Aeolian Islands, Italy. We have two primary objectives: (1) For selected suites of volcanic rocks from Alicudi, Filicudi and Salina, test the efficacy of the Magma Chamber Simulator (which has combined the capabilities of MELTS and Energy-Constrained Recharge, Assimilation, Fractional Crystallization) for modeling the compositional evolution from basalt to dacite by generating quantitative models that reproduce published major and trace element and Sr isotope trends. Model results will provide predictions about the compositions and abundances of melt+minerals along open-system liquid lines of descent. With the framework provided by these models, we propose collection of selected suites of rocks followed by acquisition of new textural and in situ (major element by electron probe, trace element by laser ablation ICPMS, and microsampled Sr isotopes) data of crystals, glass and melt inclusions. These new data will be evaluated in context of MCS results to explore two fundamental questions: (a) Is the MCS an effective modeling tool for complex systems? (b) What can we learn about the structure and dynamics of magma bodies associated with these islands? (2) Develop thermal models of the subducted slab and mantle wedge and, in conjunction with phase equilibria constraints (Perple_X and pMELTS), constrain the range of intensive thermodynamic variables relevant to mantle wedge partial melting. Then, based on a Monte-Carlo approach, using pMELTS, we will forward model (1) the composition of wedge partial melts by varying source composition, pressure, fO2, H2O content and style of melting, and (2) using the compositions of these melts, explore compositional changes that occur as melts ascend polybarically and partially crystallize. Best results from this two-stage approach will inform trace element analysis, which will apply published mineral-melt-fluid partition coefficients to closed system melting and crystallization equations for fluid-saturated systems. 197 Model data will be compared with major and trace element and phase equilibria data of the most mafic samples identified on Alicudi, Filicudi and Salina. The fundamental question being explored is what are the dominant controls on parental magma compositions in this subduction setting? Novel aspects of our proposed work include using innovative (but tested) computational models to simultaneously model major and trace element ± Sr isotopes variations in complex magmatic suites. Predictions about characteristics of components of volcanic rocks—crystals, glass, melt inclusions—are tested by taking advantage of recent innovations in textural and in situ data analysis. The end result of this marriage of state-of-the-art petrologic tools is testable models of how magmas form and evolve. If this approach is successful, it will impact how petrologists approach studying complex magmatic systems and will also provide a methodology by which source to surface compositional diversity can be understood by combining computational and analytical methods.",2008,2012

A major advance would be to understand the number sizes and histories of the various blocks that make up a UHP terrane. This proposal is to test whether UHP orogens form through repeated subduction of the same tectonic unit or through sequential subduction of different units by examining a specific example the Western Gneiss Region of Norway. Following careful petrology zircon genesis will be assessed by optical and back-scattered electron petrography cathodoluminescence trace-element abundances and Raman spectroscopy. Single grains and grain fragments will be analyzed by TIMS select populations by CA-TIMS and inherited cores by LA-MC-ICP-MS. Following reconnaissance SIMS dating single grains and grain fragments will be analyzed by TIMS. The strength of this approach lies in its use of state-of-the-art zircon geochronology and petrology collaboration with researchers at cutting-edge facilities and our familiarity with other ultrahigh- pressure orogens. The impact of this research should be considerable and broadly applicable because of the archetypal nature of the Norwegian UHP terrane.,2009,2012

Here high-grade rocks that have been exhumed along orogen-parallel thrust faults and low angle detachment faults that were active until the middle Miocene have received considerable attention. In several regions the major structures that bound these mid-crustal rocks the Main Central thrust (MCTZ) below and South Tibetan detachment system (STDS) above are offset or reactivated by young metamorphic domes. Our recently obtained data from the Ama Drime Massif (ADM) suggest that it is another example of active orogen-parallel extension that has dominated the southern margin of the Tibetan Plateau since the middle Miocene. Young metamorphic domes and their interaction with older shear zone/fault systems provide an important opportunity to study orogen-parallel mid-crustal flow and exhumation within an active convergent setting.,2009,2012

At its western end the NAF splinters into several strands with bends and jogs. These geometries and fault interactions are responsible for the extensional Marmara Sea trough, a composite Quaternary structure that includes three main basins with water depths >1200m, separated by submarine ridges. This boundary has been widely considered the type-transform for “pull-apart” structures, and the resulting Marmara basin is one of the best-studied transform basins in the world. Marmara is thus an ideal setting in which to address the following fundamental questions regarding transform basins: 1) What are the patterns of basin growth in space and time, and how do they relate to the deformation at depth? 2) Can the recent tectonic regime be extrapolated back to the onset of the sedimentary basins (i.e., steady- state tectonics), or have tectonics changed through time? 3) What are the geometries of major faults, and how is plate motion partitioned between them? 4) How are faults in Marmara influenced by pre-existing structures? The recent international focus on the Marmara Sea has led to shallow, very high-resolution seismic surveys that map the surface and near-surface traces of faults and sediment failures as well as deep penetration, low-resolution multichannel seismic (MCS) surveys that image the deep basin and crustal structure. In July 2008, the proponents acquired >2700 km of high-resolution MCS reflection data throughout Marmara that fills the resolution gap between those datasets. The TAMAM (Turkish- American Marmara Multichannel) Project was funded by NSF in 2003, but was delayed by scheduling difficulties. In 2008, the proponents used the science budget to lease the R/V K. Piri Reis, operated by Dokuz Eylül University (DEU) in Izmir. Two additional days will be collected in Summer 2009. This dataset ties the faults at depth to their shallower structure where they interact with gravity-collapse and sedimentation patterns, and is thus ideal to resolve the pattern of growth in the basins. Processing and interpretation are ongoing together with our Turkish collaborators at DEU and Istanbul Technical University (ITU), within the constraints of our depleted science budget. This research will continue analysis and interpretation of TAMAM and other datasets to reconstruct the tectonic evolution of Marmara in the last ~1 Ma and to address the questions above. More advanced processing and detailed stratigraphic and structural interpretations of existing seismic data will be undertaken to determine the times at which different fault systems were active, slip rates on major faults, and the stratigraphic response to tectonics and climate. These observations can be used to quantify slip partitioning and changes in tectonics through time. Initial inspection of the TAMAM data indicates that downslope motion and gas are common throughout the basin, and their distribution will be mapped in order to assess their importance in 194 filling the basin and their response to tectonics. Pre-stack depth migration (PSDM) will also be applied to select profiles from the deep-penetration Seismarmara survey to obtain better estimates of fault geometry. Finally, isostatically-balanced kinematic reconstructions will be performed using the mapped sequences to test the predicted subsidence and sedimentation patterns arising from competing models for fault configuration at depth.",2009,2012

In metamorphic petrology the EPMA will be used to address key tectonic problems such as the exhumation of ultrahigh-pressure rocks melting of sediments in subduction zones flow of the lower crust and heating and cooling histories of xenoliths. It will also be used to address methodological issues such as linking thermobarometry and accessory phase chemistry to geochronology. In igneous petrology we will use the EPMA to understand magma-body dynamics through analyses of crystal zoning to test thermodynamic models of trace-element distributions and to understand magma PT paths through analysis of glass inclusions. In sedimentary petrology EPMA can be used to understand erosion and sediment transport during orogenesis and to understand surface processes and shallow-crustal deformation by providing a superior tuff-correlation tool. In geochronology a modern EPMA is central to making progress in using rutile as a thermochronometer characterizing the complexity of phases such as rutile and sphene prior to age determination interpreting U-Pb REE ages in light of garnet trace-element zoning understanding complex dissolution systematics and behavior during chemical-abrasion TIMS of zircon and monazite and in characterizing standards for laser-ablation ICPMS. In structural geology EPMA (and ICP) measurements of Ti in quartz will give us a previously unexploited means for assigning temperatures to deformation mechanisms. In geobiology EPMA may help break new ground in assessing how microbes acquire energy from sources physically bound or concealed in solids identifying intracellular inclusions in methanotrophs and identifying the imprint of anaerobic methanotrophs in the geologic record.,2009,2012

It ruptured unilaterally about 250 km beneath the predominantly northeast-trending Longmen Shan a steep high mountain range that bounds the Tibetan Plateau to the northwest and the Sichuan Basin to the southeast. The strong ground shaking caused over 5 million buildings to collapse and nearly 70000 fatalities. The occurrence of this major earthquake surprised most of the geoscience community because the source region historically lacks large earthquakes and has a very low slip rate based on geological and geodetic data. Preliminary analysis revealed a highly complex rupture process where the seismic moment was roughly equally partitioned on the sub-parallel low-angle Pengguan and the high-angle Beichuan faults‚Äîa feature that has never been documented in the literature. This event has few large aftershocks which might be a common feature of large earthquakes in the Tibetan plateau and its vicinity though the reason for this is not clear. This catastrophic earthquake and its aftershock sequence will be investigated with seismic geodetic and geological observations. The rupture process will be constrained to match the tectonic background and surface observations and at the same time be consistent with rupture dynamics that includes a constitutive friction law. This research addresses the following questions: i) Are the rupture characteristics of this event different from other well studied thrust earthquakes such as 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake perhaps reflecting its abnormal tectonic loading process? ii) How could the thrust rupture initiate on the high angle Beichuan fault? What effect did the nucleation have on the subsequent rupture? iii) How did the ruptures on two faults dynamically interact? iv) What are the characteristics of the ground motion excited by this earthquake? Are the ground motions unusual compared with other large thrust events?,2009,2012

Twenty-three years of research at the Emerald Lake watershed (Sequoia National Park) has shown that runoff patterns and the timing of snowmelt alter nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) biogeochemistry with concomitant changes in lake trophic conditions. Recent evidence indicates that Sierran lakes are undergoing eutrophication while shifting from P to N limitation; altered rates of atmospheric deposition of N and P and changes in P biogeochemistry of soils and lake sediments are likely causes. Observing and understanding the causes and consequences of these multi-year trends and variations in ecological conditions, requires appropriately designed long-term measurements complemented by experiments and modeling. The project investigators propose to continue long-term study of the Emerald Lake watershed and nearby catchments in order to test conceptual hypotheses regarding drivers of environmental change in high-elevation aquatic ecosystems. The primary foci of the proposed study are: i) continued assessment of the response of lake phytoplankton to changing inputs of N and P and ii) continued study of the coupling between climate variability and N and P biogeochemistry. To further examine the effects of ongoing eutrophication, the proposed study also seeks to answer the following questions: a) At what rate is phosphorus being atmospherically deposited in the Sierra Nevada from anthropogenic and natural sources like fire? b) How do modern input rates of P to Emerald Lake and similar sites differ from those over the last two hundred years? c) How is P in the soils mobilized and transformed and how are these processes modified by variation in climate and hydrology? d) How much P is released from lacustrine sediments and how do the rates of release change as a function of variations in stratification, pH, dissolved oxygen and dissolved metals? These questions will be answered through the continuation of ongoing watershed measurements; additional study of P pools, transformation and fluxes in soils and sediments; enhanced measurements of atmospheric deposition; and paleolimnological study of lake sediments. Climate conditions have a strong influence on potential P source areas, on the incidence of fires, on transport and deposition, and on ecological impacts. Hence, as a consequence of the considerable interannual variability in California’s Mediterranean climate, it is essential to conduct these studies for at least five to ten years.",2007,2013

The age and uplift history of the Sierra are currently the subject of geologic debate by workers using a variety of data sources and analytical tools including U-Th-He thermochronology fission track analyses paleobotanical studies dating of cave sediments oxygen isotope analysis of authigenic minerals and analysis of relict landscape. This study will address the following questions: (1) What can Tertiary strata preserved in paleochannels tell us about the evolution of the central Sierran landscape and how does its evolution compare with the rest of the range? (2) What can Neogene volcanic and intrusive rocks centers in the central Sierra Nevada tell us about the paleogeographic and tectonic evolution of the Tertiary Ancestral Cascades arc? (3) When did Neogene range-front faulting begin in the central Sierra Nevada what is its nature and has it proceeded continuously or episodically? Faults at the Sierra Nevada - Basin and Range boundary are important for determining the kinematic boundary conditions for transtensional deformation in the Walker Lane Belt.

A Case Study of the Pamir,Continent collisions past and present are studied to understand their influences on plate driving forces the refining of the continental crust geochemical recycling topography climate change etc. For many years and for good reasons Tibet has been the preferred site of study. Tibet however has one significant limitation: it has few exposures of Cenozoic lower crustal rocks. In contrast the Pamir the western extension of the Tibetan Plateau has multiple domes s exposing Cenozoic lower crustal rocks. The Pamir thus present an important opportunity for understanding the role of the lower crust in continent collisions. This proposal focuses on determining how the lower crust thickened and grew during the Cenozoic evolution of the Pamir with the expectation that these findings will apply to continent collisions in general. There are two endmember models for crustal thickening and growth during collision a ‚Äòbrittle‚Äô model el based on folding and imbrication of the crust and subduction of mantle lithosphere and a ‚Äòductile‚Äô model that calls upon large-scale flow of the lower crust in response to gravitational potential energy gradients. We can test these models in the Pamir within the framework of three hypotheses: The Pamir lower crust was 1) thickened and exhumed by local intracontinental shortening during the Cenozoic 2) thickened by Cenozoic long-distance flow and exhumed by local intracontinental shortening during the Cenozoic or 3) thickened and exhumed mostly before the India‚ÄìAsia collision. These hypotheses can be evaluated by studying the Pamir domes and measuring the distribution in space and time of ages of magmatism ages of crustal thickening ages of exhumation depths of exhumation and deformation associated with formation and exhumation of the domes. This is a collaborative work: UCSB researchers will use U/Pb dating of zircon to determine crystallization ages of plutons Lu-Hf and Sm-Nd dating to measure crustal thickening ages and thermobarometry to determine exhumation depths; Freiberg researchers will use 40Ar/39Ar fission-track and (U-Th)/He/He dating to constrain thermal histories and conduct structural analysis to determine the deformation histories of the domes.,2009,2013

However, the key to understanding tundra soil processes is nitrogen (N), as both plant growth and decomposition are severely N limited. However, current models of tundra ecosystems and their responses to climate change assume that while N limits plant growth, C limits decomposition. In addition, N availability is strongly seasonal with relatively high availability early in the growing season followed by a pronounced crash. There is a need to understand the controls on this seasonality to predict Arctic System responses to climate change, but there are multiple questions that need answers: 1) What causes the seasonal nutrient crash? 2) Does microbial activity switch seasonally between C and N limitation? 3) How will a lengthening of the growing season alter overall ecosystem C and N dynamics, as a result of differential extension of the periods before and after the nutrient crash? 4) What will be the larger impacts of these patterns on the Arctic system? Addressing these questions requires following plant and soil dynamics in a very tight time frame, coupling this understanding of the timing of C and N interactions to an enhanced mechanistic understanding of why the nutrient crash occurs, and then using transect sampling and ecosystem modeling to explore the large-scale implications of this seasonal crash. This proposed research will address our questions by: 1) Varying the length and timing of the growing season in the field by advancing snow melt and warming the ecosystem; 2) Establishing the fine scale seasonal time- courses of soil N availability, plant N content, leaf expansion, root growth and rhizodeposition, ecosystem respiration, microbial biomass and enzyme activity; 3) Conducting lab experiments to determine the extent to which microbial activity is limited by temperature, and C and N availability before and after the crash; 4) Determining how the timing of the nutrient crash and plant growth vary across a latitudinal transect; 5) Refining the Multiple Element Limitation model (MEL) that was developed for arctic ecosystems to better handle how plant and microbial systems respond to N limitation, and incorporating the specific drivers of the crash into MEL; 6) Testing the large-scale spatial and temporal effects of the seasonality of nutrient availability and how it may change in a warming Arctic with a lengthening growing season. This work will require intense mechanistic research focusing on transitions and transformations that occur over only a few weeks at most, but which have profound impacts on the tundra ecosystem. Researchers will scale this mechanistic work to the intermediate spatial scale by conducting transect measurements along a latitudinal transect to validate that patterns that occur locally are robust. They will scale to the whole Arctic system by integrating these mechanisms, and importantly, the N-effects on decomposition, into the MEL model that is designed to explore 163 multiple limiting resource effects on ecosystem function. As an integrated package, this research will explore how the changing seasonal pattern that drives the crash in N availability in tundra soils will alter overall tundra C-cycling and its role as a source or sink of C and through this its role in the global climate system.",2009,2013

Recent work suggests that a pulse in ocean oxygenation ~580 million years ago may have permitted the evolution of animals, but almost no consideration has been paid to the relationship between biology and fluctuating oxygen levels earlier in the Neoproterozoic, in particular spanning the Cryogenian (a.k.a. ‘snowball Earth’) glaciations ~720 to 635 million years ago, when Earth may have been entombed in ice. The aim of this project is two-fold: (1) reconstruct oxygen levels and biology during the Cryogenian glacial interval; and (2) test the hypothesis that fluctuating oxygen levels are linked to changes in the diversity and composition of biological communities observed during this time. To address these goals, the Senior Personnel and their collaborators will undertake micropaleontological, geochemical, and geochronologic analyses of shales collected from successions in Svalbard, an archipelago north of Norway, and in four separate basins in Australia. Collectively, these units span the entire interval of Cryogenian glaciation. Samples from Svalbard have already been collected; samples from Australia will be collected during two field seasons, one in Tasmania, the other on the Australian mainland.

Plant litter decomposition is the main control on soil fertility and carbon (C) sequestration. There is growing interest in understanding the conditions under which soils gain or lose C, in part, because soils contain more C than the atmosphere and could play either a moderating or exacerbating role in global warming. An integrated field, laboratory, and modeling study of the biochemical mechanisms driving interactions between soil C sequestration, plant litter chemistry, and microbial community composition and activity during decomposition is 164 needed to define these relationships. Moorhead and Sinsabaugh (2006) developed a new model that incorporates microbial dynamics into the decomposition process, the Guild Decomposition Model (GDM), which has generated a series of specific hypotheses about the mechanisms controlling the interactions between plant litter chemistry, C stabilization and microbial community composition and activity during decomposition. The proposed research will evaluate these hypotheses experimentally by monitoring changes in plant litter chemistry and microbial community composition and function during decomposition, with and without added N to mimic N deposition. Stable C isotope (13C) labeling will further determine the community composition of active microorganisms capable of metabolizing specific chemical components of plant litter. This research will provide mechanistic insight into the impacts on plant litter decomposition and soil C sequestration from N deposition, elevated CO2, plant community composition shifts, and climate change. The PI and a graduate student will travel to Ohio regularly to coordinate with the University of Toledo and cooperating groups on the field work, setting up and running incubations on the litter samples in Dr. Mike Weintraub’s lab. We will then return litter samples to UCSB and analyze them for 13C-labeled phospholipid fatty acids.

203p,Douglas Burbank,7/1/09,9/30/13,282370,National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,838265,Controls on growth of the Puna Plateau NW Argentina,Both the mechanisms of growth of orogenic plateaus and the processes that control or limit their growth remain controversial. Within currently active orogens only two large-scale orogenic plateaus have developed during Cenozoic times. At the broadest scale their growth has been driven by sustained plate convergence. If such convergence continues into the future will these plateaus continue to expand? What controls whether they reach a stable size continuously expand or begin to shrink or collapse? This proposal focuses on the limits to outward growth of plateaus and the interplay between tectonic forcing and erosion that modulates changes in plateau margins. We focus on one mode of plateau growth: synchronous growth of thrust-related ranges with filling of high ponded intermontane basins that is hypothesized to be favored during times of relative aridity. The enhanced crustal loads represented by the basin-range couplet are proposed to drive outward propagation of deformation. Whereas this concept is not new few studies have tested the synchrony of thrusting basin filling and climate change. Little is known of the rates at which these processes occur or of the trade-offs that develop as climate and tectonics conspire to modulate active thrusting aggradation and erosion. Do rates of fault slip regulate base level and control when internal versus external drainages prevail? Or do changes in regional climate cause significant variations in rates of erosion and basin filling that in turn influence slip on nearby thrust faults? Do intermontane aggradational intervals correspond with times of outward propagation of the thrust belt or is increased aridity a key control or both? How do the style pace and rate of thrusting respond to pulses of sediment loading and removal? The answers to these questions will place valuable constraints on the viability of this ‚Äúrange and basin‚Äù model for plateau growth. Any test of the model requires excellent time control on a clearly delineated depositional and erosional history of intermontane basins and of the growing ranges to which they are potentially linked. We propose a study along the NE margin of the Puna Plateau and the adjacent Eastern Cordillera of NW Argentina. This region lies astride an abrupt climatic boundary and boasts multiple generations of late Cenozoic thrusting and basin filling and emptying. Successive faults overthrust alluvial strata and are then buried by younger gravels. Perhaps most importantly numerous volcanic ashes are preserved within the basin fills as well as within strata that are intricately interbedded with stacked sequences of thrust faults. These ashes promise to permit unprecedentedly tight time control on the growth and decay of this dynamic plateau margin and will underpin a detailed reconstruction of the interplay of range growth evolving fluvial networks and multiple cycles of basin filling and emptying. Ultimately a new temporally constrained view of the plateau margin will emerge from this study. The data collected in this study will permit us to assess the following hypotheses: 1) Range- building by active thrusting is coeval with aggradation in the intermontane basin on the hinterland side of the faults and is promoted by drier climatic conditions; 2) Outward growth of plateau margin can be stalled by breaching and erosion of intermontane basin-filling sequences; 3) Erosion of an intermontane-basin fill causes hinterland-stepping thrusting to restore topographic taper; and 4) A strengthened monsoon drives enhanced erosion and is temporally coincident with the breaching of intermontane basin fills. Our research effort will delineate the thrust-controlled growth of the Eastern Cordillera and the history of intermontane basin-filling in two basins that straddle the Puna Plateau‚Äôs margin. When synthesized with new chronologic data these will permit testing of the synchrony (or lack thereof) of changes in regional paleoclimate with changes in tectonics sedimentation and erosion across the plateau margin.,2009,2013

The proposed research aims to (1) use an existing household survey and vegetation measurement database to examine how socioeconomic and biophysical factors influence household decisions and thus the fluxes of C N and P through households along a gradient of housing density; (2) determine the effect of consumption and pollution production by single family homes on fluxes of C N and P at the scale of the urban-exurban study region; and (3) examine how behavioral influences can be altered through social networks to change consumption choices and therefore elemental fluxes. Thus the study will establish a feedback loop between household choices elemental fluxes and back to household choices. At U.C. Santa Barbara PI McFadden will be responsible for the development and implementation of satellite data-driven models to scale vegetation carbon fluxes from a set of 400 field-measured households to the urban study region. PI King will be responsible for the analyses of relationships between household-level choices and biogeochemical fluxes of C N and P. All PIs on the project will contribute to advising the post- docs and graduate students on the research team synthesizing the findings from the different components of the project and publication of the results. Elucidating the nature of such socio- environmental coupling should stimulate novel approaches to making cities more sustainable reducing urban pollution and reducing urban contributions to climate change.,2009,2013
205p,Roland Geyer Frank Davis David Stoms,10/1/09,9/30/13,218120,National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,CBET-0932369,Spatially-explicit Life Cycle Assessment Tools for Environmental Sustainability,The goal of this project is to expand and enhance Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) theory and practice by coupling LCA tools with the spatial analytical functions of geographic information systems (GIS). The project will apply these coupled LCA-GIS tools to model inventory flows and assess impacts on biodiversity of land use dynamics associated with biofuel crop production. Whereas land use and biodiversity are acknowledged as important elements in evaluating the environmental sustainability of product systems there are as yet no standard methods for accounting for them. Effects of land use on biodiversity depend on scale and spatial pattern of land use and land cover. In contrast LCA is traditionally linear and aspatial using average values for input and output flows. For types of impacts with small land requirements this averaging approach may be sufficient. For products with large land requirements such as agriculture and biofuels however the location and arrangement of production activities cannot be ignored. Combining LCA with GIS creates the potential to develop indicators that are meaningful for biodiversity and that can account for the spatially-dependent and non-linear consequences of land use change. This project will develop the tools to make this coupling of software systems feasible and practical for all LCA studies of product systems that have large land use requirements. GIS tools will be developed to generate inventory flows from land use in Life Cycle Inventory. Flow data will be integrated with ecological databases to create and compare various biodiversity characterization models and impact indicators. In addition to methodology and tool development it will also conduct a multidisciplinary graduate seminar in environmental sustainability and impact assessment with LCA and GIS to train a cadre of industrial ecology graduate students in this cutting-edge integration of technologies. The intellectual merit of the proposed activity is twofold: overcoming the barriers to incorporating spatial differentiation in LCA methodology and solving the omission of biodiversity concerns in LCA. Biofuel production has been chosen as a prototype product system for several reasons. Environmental economic and political concerns about fossil fuels have dramatically increased the demand for biofuel alternatives. Although the potential of biofuels to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and some other environmental impacts has been studied extensively habitat and biodiversity consequences of largescale biofuel production systems have not been rigorously analyzed. Such impacts could be substantial and could be positive or negative depending on location-specific changes in land use and land management practices. However the developed approach will be sufficiently general to be applicable to a wide range of production processes and product systems that require spatially- explicit analysis. The broader impacts of the project therefore are that it will enable the coupling of GIS and LCA more generally and that it will enhance LCA to more fully quantify environmental sustainability and the tradeoffs between biodiversity and other concerns.,2009,2013

In light of these provocative models it is time to test the channel flow hypothesis by determining whether the predicted low-viscosity channel is exposed in the North Himalayan gneiss domes and whether it shows the expected combination of southward flow and vertical thinning. Flow within a channel can range from pure Couette flow to Poiseuille flow or be a combination of the two. Couette (or linear) flow develops between rigid plates moving relative to one another and is characterized by simple shear (high vorticity number) with the highest velocities toward the top or bottom of the channel. Poiseuille (or parabolic) flow develops between stationary rigid plates in which a horizontal gradient in lithostatic pressure produces the highest velocities in the center of the channel and decreasing but opposite shear velocities toward the top and bottom of the channel. Poiseuille flow is characterized by high vorticity number (simple shear) at the top and bottom of the channel decreasing vorticity number (mix of simple shear and pure shear or general shear) toward the center of the channel and low vorticity number (pure shear) at the center of the channel.This project will document the deformation vorticities finite strain temperatures and timing during ductile flow combined with existing thermobarometric geochronologic and thermochronologic data will provide a comprehensive spatial thermal and temporal history of deformation and flow in middle crustal rocks southern Tibet. Furthermore our studies combined with similar published and ongoing studies in middle crustal rocks exposed in the high Himalaya will provide an unprecedented view of middle crustal flow parallel to the transport direction over a distance of 50100 km. Characterization of deformation over a broad range of spatial thermal and temporal scales is critical to testing models of middle crustal channel flow/extrusion within a collisional orogen and will provide invaluable insight into the role of the middle crust in the geodynamic development of the HimalayanTibetaan orogenic belt and orogenic belts in general.,2009,2014

In addition, firm-level data collection in the cement and sugar sectors in both countries will be completed by end of 2009. This data will be collected via both telephone interviews and on-site interviews with research assistants. 2. Data analysis: The data analysis phase will be conducted at PI Pulver and collaborating PI Hultman’s respective home institutions in the United States. Data analysis will include data processing, collaboration with a statistics consultant, and several meetings of the research team at both the University of California, Santa Barbara and the University of Maryland. Data analysis may also involve some follow-up contact with firm interviewees in both Brazil and India. 3. Dissemination of research findings: The dissemination phase involves, foremost, publication in appropriate peer-reviewed journals and a book format and presentation of papers at academic 156 conferences. However, we believe this research has wider relevance for international environmental policy and investment decisions, so we also intend to expand the audience for this research by presenting at the UN Climate Conference in Copenhagen (December 2009) and organizing two 1-day capstone conferences (in São Paulo, June 2010; and New Delhi, January 2011).",2009,2014
209p,Matthew Jackson,9/2/13,3/31/14,392,National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,OCE-1419915,Constraining mantle flow between Samoa and the northern Lau and N. Fiji Basins with geochemistry and geodynamics,Numerous geochemical and geophysical anomalies within the northern portion of the Lau basin-- the presence of high 3He/4He (up to 28 times atmospheric) latitudinal gradients in trace element and isotopic (Sr-Nd-Pb) enrichment and trench parallel shear wave splitting near the Tonga arc-- have been attributed to southward flow of mantle material from the nearby Samoan hotspot. However both the total extent and the spatial distribution of any intrusion of Samoanplume mantle into the region are poorly constrained. We propose to use a combination of geochemical analysis and geodynamic modeling to test two hypotheses regarding advection of material from the Samoan plume into the northern Lau basin: 1. The observed North-South gradients in Sr Nd and Pb isotopic ratios reflect progressive depletion of southward flowing Samoan-plume mantle. 2. The western extent of the Samoan plume's influence in the region extends into the northwestern Lau and North Fiji basins. We will perform geochemical analyses on samples from 12 key sites within the northwest Lau and northern North Fiji basins selected to fill important geographic voids in existing geochemical data sets. We will geochemically characterize (He Sr Nd and Pb isotopes and trace elements) a suite of 28 existing lava samples along a swath covering the northern region of the Lau and North Fiji basins. These data will greatly extend the western limit of geochemical observations in the region while simultaneously improving the resolution of North-South variations in isotopic ratios at the northern extreme of the northwest Lau and North Fiji basins. He isotopic measurements which are the most unambiguous geochemical indicator of the presence of Samoan-plume mantle will be particularly important for identifying the (currently unconstrained) western limit of Samoan intrusion. We will conduct a series of numerical geodynamic experiments to characterize melting of isotopically enriched Samoan-plume mantle by decompression as it flows southward across the boundary between old (>100 Ma) thick Pacific oceanic lithosphere and the young (<5 Ma) thin oceanic lithosphere of the Lau basin in the vicinity of the Vitiaz lineament. The resulting predicted spatial patterns in mantle depletion will be compared to the observed North-South geochemical gradients in the basins and the data obtained in this study to place constraints on the morphology of mantle flow in the region.,2013,2014

This ‚Äúproof of concept‚Äù study will gather results to evaluate the feasibility of developing this project more robustly in the future. The revised work plan will enable us to continue to push forward our work in this very important and very poorly known region. It will allow us to continue an ongoing very committed collaboration with Mexican colleagues from UNAM Luca Ferrari (since 2007) and Elena Centeno-Garcia (since 2005). The research is as follows: 1. We will digitally compile and synthesize all previous available work including unpublished maps and field data held by McDowell at UT Austin and integrate it with the new results obtained by this study (see below). We will then interpret these data in the context of rapidly- evolving models for the origin of silicic large igneous provinces and publish our findings. This will enable us to move forward with a well informed field plan once the security situation improves in Chihuahua. 2. We will perform Hf O and U-Pb isotopic analysis of zircons from several sites in the northern SMO to gain insight into the origin of the magmas in this world-class silicic large igneous province. This work will be done in close collaboration with Luca Ferrari who is doing the same kind of work on his samples from the southern SMO with Scott Bryan. Ferrari is very interested in this work and is giving us a very good price to do the Hf and U-Pb analytical work at Juriquilla; the total comes to about half the in-house rate for Busby at UCSB and substantially less than the rate posted on the University of Arizona website. In addition a UCSB Senior Honors Thesis student (to be named) will carry out textural and modal analysis of thin sections and interpret new geochemical data we will gather on pumices from the ignimbrites as well as whole rock analyses of lava flows and intrusions.,2011,2014

This research attempts to understand how Himalayan rates of erosion vary as a function of space and time and what drives such changes. Some detrital cooling-age data suggest that irrespective of how spatially irregular erosion may be at short time scales erosion rates become much steadier at longer time scales. This research will test that contention. The PIs hypothesize that at decadal to millennial scales spatial variations in rainfall distributions modulate differences in erosion rates. Specific stream power (the product of discharge and channel gradient) is hypothesized to provide a reliable proxy for modern erosion rates. To underpin tests of these hypotheses the PIs have developed and calibrated the highest resolution remotely sensed data on rainfall currently available for the Himalaya. When combined with digital topography rainfall is routed through the Himalayan landscape and predicts pronounced along-strike variations in stream power. To test whether stream power successfully predicts variations in erosion rates the PIs will collect 50 detrital cosmogenic nuclide samples within 10 catchments that exhibit strong contrasts in stream power. With judicious placement of sampling sites this large new data set should also permit testing of a much-debated question: is the rate of erosion controlled by large trunk rivers or by the erosive power of much smaller catchments (<20 km2) that cover most of the landscape? In order to assess the extent to which erosion rates change at longer time scales the PIs will collect relief transects of bedrock samples in each of the CRN-sampled catchments and will measure ~100 cooling ages each for apatite zircon and muscovite representing closure temperatures of ~80¬∞ ~200¬∞ and ~375¬∞C respectively. Reflecting different times and depths of cooling these ages will be analyzed using thermokinematic models to create reliable reconstructions of temporal changes in erosion rates at each of 10 catchments. Furthermore the PIs‚Äô current analysis suggests that topographic relief exerts a fundamental control on the distribution of Himalayan rainfall and that valleys of large rivers ‚Äúguide‚Äù moisture into the orogen. At time scales for which Himalayan topography and climate are ‚Äúconstant‚Äù spatial variations in rainfall stream power and hence erosion are therefore envisioned to remain steady. The Himalayas however are an active collisional orogen in which rocks advect laterally faster than they move vertically. The PIs hypothesize that topography also advects laterally especially in the rain shadow north of the Himalayan peaks where erosion rates appear lower. Moreover this advection is hypothesized to cause major re-organization of Himalayan drainages and related topography. If so new avenues for rainfall to move into the orogen will open old ones will close and as a consequence new patterns of erosion should emerge. As advection leads to stream capture and creation of new Transhimalayan rivers with greatly enhanced erosive power other trunk channels will be beheaded thereby losing power. Such changes in stream power should be expressed by changes in both erosion rates and topographic relief. The PIs propose to test these novel ideas by reconstructing changes in topographic relief using bedrock cooling ages both from their relief transects and from equal-elevation transects. Such dynamic Transhimalayan channels would stand in contrast to the persistence of rivers at the Himalayan ‚Äúindentor corners‚Äù. Despite the challenges presented by Himalayan landscapes they provide a propitious setting: stark lateral variations exist in rainfall erosion and topography; cooling ages are almost ubiquitously reset and strong signals of differential erosion should rise above the inevitable geomorphic and tectonic noise.,2008,2014

Measurement of bulk 10Be in NAVC sediments: The specific analytical tasks in this project include locating and obtaining samples of NAVC sediments, subsampling them for 10Be analysis, and measuring 10Be concentrations by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). Our primary source of samples will be an extensive archive of cores of NAVC sediments that PI Ridge has collected over many years and that are stored at Tufts University. One important aspect of this part of the project, however, is to ensure that subsamples are not cross-contaminated, or contaminated with modern 10Be, during collection. This requirement may restrict use of archived cores that are highly fractured or otherwise difficult to sample cleanly. If we can not obtain the samples we need from this archive, we will revisit source outcrops and collect new samples, typically by collecting short cores from outcrops using a hammered-PVC-pipe procedure that Ridge has employed for many years. Ridge will have primary responsibility for locating archived and new sample material and correlating it to the NAVC, although students will also be closely involved in this process and all project personnel will participate. 10Be concentrations are measured by an isotope dilution method in which a 9Be carrier is added to the sample, the entire sample is digested and the Be extracted, and the Be isotope ratio is measured by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). All aspects of this process are proven, reliable, and efficient. We will carry out Be extraction from sediments in a purpose-built 159 chemistry laboratory at the University of Vermont (see Facilities and Resources), using a total- fusion method described by Stone (1996) and further refined during the past few years by Balco, Bierman, and Bierman’s students. At the 10Be concentrations we expect to measure in this project (> 107 atoms g␣1), AMS measurement is rapid (a few minutes per sample) and precise (␣1-2% analytical uncertainty). Research focus 1: systematics of 10Be deposition in varved sediments. We will use several strategies in the first part of the project. First, we will investigate how 10Be is delivered to glacial and nonglacial varved sediments. We hypothesize that 10Be deposition is seasonally focused due to effects such as more effective scavenging by fine sediment during winter, suppression of fallout 10Be delivery to the lake during winter due to snow and ice cover, and the strong overall seasonality of sediment transport and deposition. We will investigate this by characterizing 10Be concentrations and their variability within both summer and winter layers to investigate seasonal effects, as well as laterally within a single varve to investigate the effect of sediment source variation between direct glacial sediment and runoff from the landscape. Understanding which, if any, of these processes are important may suggest means to preferentially sample fallout 10Be rather than recycled 10Be. Second, we will determine whether or not short-period solar variability, in particular the diagnostic 11-year Schwabe cycle, is present. As noted in many ice- core studies (Beer et al., 1994; Yiou et al., 1997; Steig et al., 1998), observing the 11-year cycle in a 10Be concentration record clearly shows that 10Be fallout variations are recorded (the reverse is not necessarily true: if we did not observe the 11-year cycle, it could signal only that it was suppressed by a multi-year residence time for fallout 10Be in the lake and catchment, which would not affect recording of centennial-scale variability). Analytical work for this part of the project will require approximately 90 10Be measurements, including paired summer and winter analyses on a number of glacial and nonglacial sections (approx. 40 analyses) and analyses of at least two short continuous sections at a resolution adequate to observe the 11-year period (e.g., two-year spacing over a 50-year period; 50 samples). Research focus 2: generating a long 10Be flux record suitable for correlation. In the second part of the project we will choose a section of the NAVC from which to generate a long 10Be record with resolution appropriate to matching the centennial-scale variations in 10Be flux observed in the Greenland ice cores, and then generate this record. At present, absent any new information we may gain from the first part of the project described above, we think the nonglacial varve section at Newbury is the most likely section of the NAVC to yield such a record, for three reasons. First, varves are relatively thin, which limits dilution of the fallout signal. Second, centennial-scale variations in 10Be flux during this time interval are suitable for correlation at the needed precision, as demonstrated by Muscheler et al. (2008). Third, this section is one of the longest continuous sections in the NAVC, which permits us to generate as long a record as possible from a single site: this avoids any potential complications related to patching together 10Be records from multiple locations within the lake system.",2011,2014

In this region, a unique hydrological dataset provides a framework to relate sediment transport changes to land-use, in the context of rapid urbanization and climate change. We will use hydrological observations and isotopic measurements to estimate sediment transport over a variety of temporal and spatial scales, determine the sources and sinks of the sediment, and tie our findings to regional land-use history. We anticipate these efforts will demonstrate that understanding the source and fate of sediment is important as it will allow us to unravel the effect of land-use on sediment transport in sensitive mountain regions undergoing population expansion, provide critical information for development and environmental conservation projects, and better allow us to use sediment flux measurements on a variety of time scales to estimate geological-time-scale rates of mass export from the landscape.",2011,2014
223p,Ralph Archuleta Chen Ji,9/1/12,8/31/14,359859,National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,EAR-1215769,Improving Resolution of Finite Inversions With Increasing Bandwidth,This project will develop new methods of inverting observations to provide more resolved and robust estimates kinematic rupture models. Without direct measurements of the fault during an earthquake the spatio-temporal evolution of the slip on the fault must be inferred from seismic geodetic and geologic observations. While the representation theorem provides the link between the spatio-temporal evolution and the observations the inverse problem has been a quagmire. The number of parameters needed to infer the details of a rupture is much larger than the number of available data i.e. the inverse problem is underdetermined. By itself that is a problem. When coupled with the fact that the temporal variables (rise time and rupture time) are not linearly related to the observations additional complexities arise in the methods for inverting the observations. Nonetheless models of the spatio-temporal evolution of slip i.e. the source process can be found. The quality of these models needs to be quantitatively assessed. As carefully enumerated by Hartzell et al. (2007) each factor from the subfault size to the selection of a misfit norm plays a role in determining a rupture model. Once a model has been determined there is still the question of how uncertain the model parameter is at each point on the fault. There are means of estimating the uncertainty of each parameter as if it were independent of the other parameters. This provides some sense of the uncertainty. One approach is to examine cross-validation i.e. predicting observations that were not used to constrain the inversion and its relationship to the uncertainty of the kinematic model. The question is not the misfit between the predictions and observations rather it is quantifying the difference between different models‚Äî uncertainty of the parameters on the fault. Many different models are found that are equally consistent with the data. A key point is that the faulting model should satisfy all of the data. While inversion methods continue to be improved with new measures of uncertainty in the models the factor that has led to the largest reduction in the space of models is the addition of new data. This is more than adding stations though that is useful but it is adding data that are independent such as GPS or InSAR. The data that exists and have not been fully exploited are the high-frequency seismic data. These data provide important constraints on stress drops and variations in rupture velocity. By using these data in concert with low-frequency seismograms GPS and InSAR the resulting kinematic models will be better resolved and more robust. Two methods are proposed for exploiting the high-frequency data. First using back projection areas on the fault that produce high-frequency radiation are identified. Using a multiscale inversion the parameters are resolved on a finer scale and used as constraints on the inversion at a larger scale. Second derivatives of the acceleration envelope function are inverted to determine regions of high-frequency radiation. These regions will also be subject to multi-scale inversion to constrain the overall inversions. In combination the two methods will improve the resolution and robustness of the inverted rupture model.,2012,2014

We used optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy to measure snow grain geometry and chemical composition. Our findings agree with laboratory experiments and sintering theory. Because of the time required for sampling and microscopy we sampled in just two locations. We now plan to extend our sampling to learn how stratigraphy and sintering vary spatially. Other studies we recently published examine how spatial variability is the driving mechanism that produces power laws in avalanche depth distributions. We will use a new method near-infrared digital photography for rapid quantitative stratigraphy and to cover the range of variability over a large mountain. We will apply this technique to snow stability evaluation and the general study of snow metamorphism. Since the measurement of snow properties with near-infrared photography is a new technique it has not been widely used and there are no peer-reviewed studies that apply it to snow stability. While the heterogeneity of grain sizes at the snow surface has been investigated with remote sensing there are many fewer studies of the heterogeneity of snow properties in buried layers especially at the slope scale. Our experience extensive instrumentation site accessibility and large number of avalanche control records make our field location Mammoth Mountain an ideal site to test how near-infrared photography can be used for avalanche hazard evaluation. We will relate mechanical strength to specific signs of instability called lemons i.e. yellow flags. We propose that four of five common lemons can be identified with nearinfrared photography alone. We will also use spatial statistics and machine-learning techniques to classify stable and unstable near- infrared snow profiles.

Because both monazite and allanite are compositionally variable and SIMS LA-ICP-MS incur instrumental mass-dependent fractionation it is essential to closely match standards with unknowns. This proposal seeks to determine isotope dilution (ID) Th-Pb ages for the Th-rich accessory minerals monazite and allanite. Th-Pb ages currently exist for only one reference material that is commonly used-'554'. Consequently all standard-based geochronologic measurements require an assumption that Th-Pb and U-Pb ages are equivalent. This assumption is unnecessary and in many cases invalid. By obtaining high-precision ID Th-Pb ages for a suite of well-characterized community-wide reference materials this research will provide a means of independently calibrating Th-Pb ages for minerals that can be linked to fundamental tectonic processes.,2011,2014

This measurement capability is essential for creating longterm satellite climate data records of the ocean biosphere – but the costs of building and deploying existing moored buoy systems are excessive ($M’s to build & ~$1M/y to deploy for each site).

The NSPB is built upon recent advances in optical profiling instrumentation designed for turbid water environments that is adapted to the calibration and validation of ocean color satellite data. The NSPB system is aimed at making day-long to week-long deployments improving the likelihood of high quality match-ups with satellite data than is possible with conventional profiling techniques. This will alleviate wire time constraints for shared research cruises, maximizing the return on research vessel time (often >$50K/day). The NSPB will be a cost- effective alternative to long-term, moored optical buoy installations for satellite ocean color sensor calibration and eliminates the need for addressing biofouling and extrapolation of subsurface signals to the sea surface, which are the major sources of uncertainty for long-term moored systems.

229p,Brad Hacker,2/1/09,1/31/15,227664,National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,838264,Collaborative Research: Testing Channel-Flow Models Using Middle-Crustal Rocks of North Himalayan Gneiss Domes,Recently formulated thermal-mechanical channel flow/extrusion models which postulate that the middle crust exposed in the high Himalaya and southern Tibet was a low-viscosity ductile material bounded above and below by coeval normal- and thrust-sense shear zones respectively that flowed and extruded to the south. In light of these provocative models it is time to test the channel flow hypothesis by determining whether the predicted low-viscosity channel is exposed in the North Himalayan gneiss domes and whether it shows the expected combination of southward flow and vertical thinning. Flow within a channel can range from pure Couette flow to Poiseuille flow or be a combination of the two. Couette (or linear) flow develops between rigid plates moving relative to one another and is characterized by simple shear (high vorticity number) with the highest velocities toward the top or bottom of the channel. Poiseuille (or parabolic) flow develops between stationary rigid plates in which a horizontal gradient in lithostatic pressure produces the highest velocities in the center of the channel and decreasing but opposite shear velocities toward the top and bottom of the channel. Poiseuille flow is characterized by high vorticity number (simple shear) at the top and bottom of the channel decreasing vorticity number (mix of simple shear and pure shear or general shear) toward the center of the channel and low vorticity number (pure shear) at the center of the channel. This project will document the deformation vorticities finite strain temperatures and timing during ductile flow combined with existing thermobarometric geochronologic and thermochronologic data will provide a comprehensive spatial thermal and temporal history of deformation and flow in middle crustal rocks southern Tibet. Furthermore our studies combined with similar published and ongoing studies in middle crustal rocks exposed in the high Himalaya will provide an unprecedented view of middle crustal flow parallel to the transport direction over a distance of 50100 km. Characterization of deformation over a broad range of spatial thermal and temporal scales is critical to testing models of middle crustal channel flow/extrusion within a collisional orogen and will provide invaluable insight into the role of the middle crust in the geodynamic development of the HimalayanTibetaan orogenic belt and orogenic belts in general. ,2009,2015

Biophysical models, consisting of ocean circulation models combined with Lagrangian particle tracking, are now widely used to provide insights into the spatial and temporal dynamics of larval connectivity that remain unobtainable through empirical approaches. However, many of the biological assumptions used to characterize larval life history in these models are quite general and the impacts of these assumptions have yet to be rigorously tested. Our goal in this proposal is to quantify How important are the details of larval biology in estimates of connectivity and long- term population dynamics? To answer this question, we propose to study the spatial and temporal impacts of larval biological factors on site-to-site connectivity and long- term population growth using a biophysical model for nearshore species in the Southern California Bight (SCB). Four major, larval biological factors will be investigated: (1) temperature effects on larval growth, maturation and mortality, (2) vertical swimming behavior, (3) spatial/temporal variability in larval production, and (4) role of habitat on settlement. Using a biophysical model of the SCB, differences in larval connectivity due to the biological factors will be assessed statistically by comparing connectivity estimates that incorporate the additional biological factors to a baseline of connectivity estimates calculated from passive, neutrally buoyant particles. We will also employ a spatial demographic model, driven by the connectivity estimates, to quantify the influence of biological factors on long-term population dynamics. The proposed work will generate significant insights into the various aspects of larval biology that are critical for determining larval connectivity and for projecting population dynamics into the future. The results of this project will improve the credible application of biophysical modeling approaches to scientific studies of coastal species as well as to marine spatial planning and -fisheries management.",2012,2015

The structure of the ophiolite makes it clear that the crust formed in an extensional environment similar to modern fast-spreading mid-ocean ridges, making it an invaluable resource for studying MOR processes. However, many researchers have also highlighted important differences between the Oman- U.A.E. ophiolite and modern ridges, including geochemical differences between MOR basalts and extrusive lavas in the ophiolite and the presence of multiple generations of plutonism and volcanism within the mantle and crust. To determine how observations from the ophiolite can be applied to modern spreading centers, it is necessary to understand the tectonic setting during formation and emplacement of the ophiolite. The Principal Investigator recently completed an extensive U-Pb zircon geochronology and Nd isotope study of the ophiolite. The results from this study, together with previous work by other researchers, suggest that the age and composition of magmatism that post-dates formation of the ophiolite crust can provide important new insight into the tectonic history of the ophiolite. The proposed research would target three series of rocks: silicic sills and dikes in the mantle with Nd isotopic ratios that are distinct from the ophiolite crust; intrusive and extrusive rocks in the crust that post date the main phase of crustal growth; and leucocratic melts and amphibolite to granulite facies metamorphic rocks from the metamorphic sole. The distinct isotopic and geochemical compositions of the first two series are likely related to development of a thrust fault or subduction zone below the ophiolite. Initial U-Pb zircons dates from these rocks are <0.1–0.25 Ma younger than the ophiolite crust. Further high precision geochronology and geochemical analyses, including Nd and Hf isotopic analyses, will map out the spatial and temporal development of subduction or thrusting along the length of the ophiolite. High-precision U-Pb zircon geochronology and geochemistry of the metamorphic sole will provide complementary information on conditions in the under thrust slab. This project will provide fundamental new insight into the tectonic development of the Oman-U.A.E. ophiolite and place direct temporal constraints on models of ophiolite genesis.",2013,2015

Inclusions reveal major and trace element diversity that is not clear from analyses of whole rock lavas alone and the origin of this diversity continues to be a source of vigorous debate. One end member hypothesis is that the diversity in inclusions reflects heterogeneity in mantle source compositions. Alternatively the diversity of inclusion compositions may result from magmatic processes including crustal assimilation. In a groundbreaking discovery extreme Pb-isotopic variability‚Äîspanning 50% of the range identified in global ocean island and MORB lavas‚Äîwas measured in olivine hosted melt inclusions from a single lava collected from the island of Mangaia (Cook Austral Islands). While many of the Mangaia inclusions host a Pb-isotopic component similar to lavas from the island a surprising result was that some inclusions host less radiogenic Pb-isotopic ratios never before seen in Mangaian lavas. The origin of the Pb isotopic diversity in these inclusions is not well understood and the discovery of isotopic variability gave rise to a host of fundamental questions. Why is it that the inclusions are not isotopically representative of the bulk magma? Is it because inclusions from a single lava trap melts from isotopically-diverse mantle sources? Or does the isotopic diversity reflect assimilation of the lithosphere during magma ascent? Unfortunately bulk abundances of elements most sensitive to crustal assimilation (like B Cl and K) have never been paired with Pb-isotopic compositions in the same inclusions from Mangaia. As a result it has not been possible to evaluate whether the Pb-isotopic variability in Mangaia inclusions relates to mantle source variability or crustal assimilation. In an attempt to evaluate the origin of the isotopic variability in inclusions from Mangaia the PI used start-up funds to undertake a pilot study with his student (Ms. Rita Cabral) in which 14 inclusions from Mangaia were analyzed for major trace and volatile elements. The data from the pilot study are intriguing and hint at a possible role for crustal assimilation. However the data are limited and robust conclusions cannot be drawn without additional data and mantle source variability is possible. In particular Pb-isotopic measurements on the inclusions are necessary to determine whether proxies for crustal assimilation relate to the Pb-isotopic variability. Thus this proposal seeks funding to make additional measurements to test the following hypotheses: 1.) If the Pb isotopic diversity in Mangaia inclusions is a result of crustal assimilation processes the Pb-isotopic compositions will correlate with indices of assimilation (e.g. high Cl and B). 2.)

Under this project LCIs of renewable energy technologies and other low-carbon energy technologies are compiled, and they are connected to different policy scenarios that mitigate 208 greenhouse gas emissions from 2010 to 2050. This model accounts for technology change and changing energy mix over time, but the model does not currently interact with policy interventions. Coupling the data and results acquired from this project with a system dynamics model will enable us to simulate different policy and technology scenarios. The data and the model that have been compiled so far do not include those of shale gas development. Therefore, after construction of the integrative model, we will add the component of shale gas and develop an array of technology and policy scenarios to simulate potential influences that rising shale gas production would exert on the rest of the energy sector, particularly on renewable energy technologies.

Grasslands in California cover over 10 million hectares (Jackson, 1985), are dominated by annual grasses, and are important ecosystems in the State. However, we have found comparable microbial dynamics in California grassland and Bishop pine forest, so we have confidence that the mechanisms we evaluate occur in other ecosystem types as well. The research will take place at the UCSB Sedgwick Reserve, which is located 50 km from the coast in the Santa Ynez Valley (43o42 ́30 ́ ́N, 120o2 ́30 ́ ́W). The climate is Mediterranean and characteristic of interior California, with hot dry summers and cool wet winters. Average rainfall is 380 mm/yr, but varies widely; El Niño years are notably rainy. The soils are pachic argixerolls in valley bottoms and typic argixerolls on slopes. The vegetation is dominated by Mediterranean annual grasses including Bromus diandrus, B. hordaceous, and Avena fatua. Our main site will be in the Figueroa watershed previously studied by Schimel and Holden. Analyzing the mechanisms involved requires controlled microcosm experiments that will be described below, but to explore how these mechanisms regulate how varying plant C inputs and moisture influence soil C storage, we propose a field experiment in which we modify: 1) plant C- inputs during the growing season (by thinning), and 2) the length of the dry season (by watering & rainout shelters). We will establish 3 blocks of 16 plots each (1 m x 1m) and establish a 165 factorial design in which we create gradients of plant inputs and the length of the summer drought. We will use modeling to integrate between the micro- and macro-scales. To modify plant inputs we will thin plots by hand to remove either 1/3, 2/3 or all the biomass (plus a control). Plots will be established initially after plants germinate in the fall of 2012 and new sprouts will be removed weekly or as necessary to maintain these approximate proportions. Soil moisture is likely to vary as transpiration losses will be lower in the thinned plots, but surface evaporation may partially compensate. Importantly, annual grasses senescence and die shortly after seed-set, not when the soils dry out. Thus, at the beginning of the summer, there will be a suite of plots with different amounts of dead roots to serve as substrate within the soils, with relatively similar moisture conditions (depending on the timing of spring rainfall). Dry-down after senescence will be purely by evaporation. Moisture manipulations will include control, lengthened summer drought, shortened drought, and no drought. To extend the drought, we will build rainout shelters to prevent rewetting during the winter following the thinning treatments. To shorten the drought, we will use weekly drip irrigation. The goal is not to keep soils constantly wet, but to mimic episodic precipitation and prevent soils from drying fully. The short-drought treatment will be irrigated into July, then allowed to dry normally, roughly halving the length of the typical drought. The no-drought treatment will be watered into October. We will regularly weed the watered-plots during the summer to remove new sprouts. Soil moisture will be monitored continuously (using soil moisture probes and dataloggers) in the experimental plots. Soil samples will be collected from all treatments to analyze C dynamics at four points through the year: 1) At peak live plant biomass late in the growing season (April/May), 2) early summer (just before the short-drought watering ends; late June), 3) midsummer (August), and 4) the end of the dry season (October or early January for the extended drought treatment). We will collect samples from the top 10 cm and analyze the essential C pools, including roots, light and heavy fraction OM, microbial biomass, etc. As these measures will be coupled to the work specifically testing the research hypotheses, we describe the details of those analyses in those sections. The field sampling will assess how environmental factors (C-supply and moisture) regulate C-pools and microbial activities, and the begin identifying the mechanisms connecting them. We will couple these to laboratory incubation studies to tease apart the specific mechanisms.",2012,2015

We plan to use ~30 10Be analyses to undertake a low- resolution sampling of the 1-12 Ma portion of the section at a density of ~1 sample per 330 Myr. We plan to use several 10Be samples on modern sediment and divide the remaining 10Be samples between two sections of the stratigraphy that show the best opportunity for developing a high-resolution record of paleo-erosion rates. Such sections will be characterized by well-resolved paleomagnetic reversals anchored by new tephrachronology with high-resolution U- Pb zircon ages. As mentioned above we will likely focus on a 1.2-Myr interval between 7.4 ‚Äì 6.2 Ma which is currently bracketed by two ashes and contains 7 reversals. Nine additional samples in this interval would provide a resolution of ~1 sample per 100 kyr capable of resolving 400-kyr cyclicity. An additional 11 samples would then be collected from a ~100 kyr long interval allowing a nominal resolution of ~8.3 kyr per sample capable of resolving variations as short as 23 ka. For comparison we would like to repeat the above sampling strategy on a ~ 1-Myr-long interval in the late Pliocene/early Pleistocene after the onset of northern hemisphere glaciation at ~ 2.8 Ma. The 20 additional 10Be samples focused on this interval would be paired with 26Al and 21Ne analyses in the same samples in an effort to implement the full 3-isotope approach described above. 5-10 of these 21Ne analyses will be paired with 10Be samples to develop a cross-calibration and compute nucleogenic 21Ne whereas the remaining 10-15 21Ne samples will be used to extend the low-resolution record back as far as 12 Ma.,2012,2015

It will build on earlier work by PIs Maloof and Porter and their collaborators that used radiometrically calibrated carbon isotope chemostratigraphy to reconstruct the pattern of appearances through this interval at two million year resolution. That work suggested that the diversification of skeletal animals began early and extended throughout this interval, with pulses of appearances ca. 540–538 Ma, 534–530 Ma, and 524–522 Ma. However, it is not clear to what extent preservational biases and uncertainties in correlation and dating have influenced these patterns. This research effort will use recently developed statistical methods to address these concerns. In particular, it will (1) use a new method developed by PI Wang and colleagues to estimate a confidence interval for the duration of the diversification (and thus provide an estimate of its rate), and (2) use both a randomization procedure and a new method developed by Wang and an undergraduate student to identify the most likely number of pulses of origination and their timing. As a side benefit, this work will also provide estimates of the time of origination for the skeletal genera in the database, as well as estimates of recovery potential and diversity curves.

240p,Brad Hacker,6/1/11,5/31/15,266136,National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,EAR-1008760,Collaborative Research: The Suturing Process: Insight from the India-Asia Collision Zone,The suturing of continental fragments following the subduction of intervening oceanic lithosphere is a fundamental process in lithospheric dynamics and the shaping and growth of Earth‚Äôs continents. However our understanding of this fundamental process remains limited. Can we use geological observations in some particularly well-exposed suture zones to make general statements about how landscapes and sedimentary basins evolve during suturing? What geodynamic processes lead to decreases in plate convergence rate? Are Mediterranean-style rollback of remnant oceanic lithosphere and opening of marginal oceanic basins characteristic of all or most pre-climax collision zones? Do presuturing ophiolite obduction and intraoceanic arc‚Äì continental margin interactions leave predictable signatures in suture zones? How is the upper continental plate preconditioned by pre-suturing tectonism and how does the upper plate evolve during the transition from oceanic to continental subduction? Is there a predictable mode of deformation in the downgoing continental plate? And what do we expect the balance to be among continental subduction and erosive removal of mass from a collisional orogenic system? We propose to address such questions through a 4-year investigation of the archetypal India‚ÄìAsia collision zone (IACZ) in southern Tibet that involves 19 investigators and 14 graduate students from 9 different institutions. Techniques to be employed include structural geology stratigraphy geochronology thermochronology stable and radiogenic isotope geochemistry igneous and metamorphic petrology paleomagnetism and geodynamical modeling. We aim to determine the: (1) evolution of paleogeography and paleoelevation during the transition from oceanic subduction to mature continental collision; (2) geodynamic processes that caused marked decreases in India‚Äì Asia convergence rate; (3) role of Mediterranean-style opening and closing of marginal basins prior to terminal collision; (4) metamorphic evolution of lower-plate (Indian) rocks in response to ophiolite emplacement possible intra-oceanic arc collision and continent collision; (5) role of pre-collisional Andean-style magmatism and deformation in preconditioning the upper-plate lithosphere and how this Andean-style system evolved during continent collision; (6) paleogeography of the Neo-Tethys margins and the history of subduction exhumation thickening and underthrusting/rollback of Greater Indian continental lithosphere; and (7) spatial pattern magnitude and history of erosion and sediment dispersal. Our aims are ambitious but feasible because of the presence of rich but as yet untapped geological records of appropriate age (Cretaceous to Miocene) adjacent to and within the India‚ÄìAsia suture zone. Geodynamical modeling of suturing processes will run in parallel with the geological studies; this vital effort will help guide the evolving project. Whereas the IACZ will be used as our lab we expect that our project deliverables (3-D pre- syn- and post-suturing reconstructions at the lithosphere scale) will provide fresh well-constrained and testable ideas about the suturing process and its role in continental crustal genesis.,2011,2015
241p,Jordan Clark,6/1/13,5/31/15,121801,National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,OCE-1260353,Collaborative Research: Completing single- and cross-hole hydrogeologic and microbial experiments: Juan de Fuca Flank,Below the seafloor lies one of the biggest aquifers on Earth. Here bottom seawater is drawn into basaltic crust and flows vast distances before discharging driven by Earth‚Äôs natural heat loss and associated differences in fluid density and guided by permeable pathways and basement outcrops that link oceanic and crustal realms. The extent of oceanic hydrothermal flow rivals that from rivers to the oceans influencing ocean chemistry crustal properties and a poorly- understood subseafloor biosphere. However little is known about the nature of flow paths and rates of flow through the crust how different crustal regions are connected laterally and vertically and how this flow influences crustal microbial populations. We propose to complete a series experiments to resolve processes and characteristics of hydrothermal circulation in the ocean crust using long- term borehole observatories (CORKs) as perturbation monitoring and sampling points. This phase of experiments was initiated in 2010 and 2011 following ocean drilling operations to install observatory infrastructure and instrument systems deep below the seafloor. We have combined a series of short-term and long-term pumping and discharge experiments lasing hours to years with a multi-tracer injection experiment to quantify solute dissolved gas and particle flow velocities directions and crustal interactions. Hydrogeologic experiments like these have been performed on land to elucidate conditions in hydrocarbon reservoirs and freshwater aquifers but they have never before been attempted in the ocean crust. Using the same boreholes we are monitoring natural pressure conditions and perturbations the extent of isothermality in the upper crust the chemical evolution of borehole and crustal fluids and the nature and extent of microbial growth in incubators containing chips of rock and minerals. Cross-hole pressure perturbations have been observed and sparse wellhead sampling of fluids from one borehole has recovered tracers injected in a different borehole (hundreds of meters away) demonstrating that the hydrogeologic and tracer experiments are working. But the most complete multi-year records of experimental results remain to be recovered. We request support for a 12-day ROV/submersible expedition to recover downhole instruments installed in the CORKs and to retrieve seafloor instruments and a final suite large volume samples then seal the boreholes for future use. Shore-based activities will include hydrogeologic and tracer analyses microbial characterization and integration of physical chemical and microbial data to constrain crustal conditions properties and processes.,2013,2015

However the fate of the subducted package--oceanic crust and sediment--in the mantle is poorly understood. A long-standing hypothesis maintains that subducted materials residue in the mantle for an extended but unknown period of time and are then recycled back to the Earth's surface in regions of buoyantly upwelling mantle and melted beneath hotspots. If this hypothesis is correct ocean island basalts (OIB) erupted at hotspots should exhibit geochemical signatures associated with the crustal protoliths that were injected into the mantle at a subduction zone in the geologic past. However it has been difficult to unequivocally detect geochemical signatures of ancient subducted materials in hotspot lavas. This project will use measurements of mass independently fractionated sulfur (MIF-S) isotope signatures--made using two complementary techniques--in key hotspot lavas to trace crustal cycling from the surface through the mantle and back again.,2014,2015

The Royal Society Range lies approximately 90km ESE of McMurdo Station in the TransAntarctic Mountains while the Darwin Glacier area is 200 km SW from McMurdo Station immediately north of the Byrd Glacier. I hypothesize that these two areas represent the northern and southern boundaries (respectively) of a geologically distinct segment within the southern Victoria Land sector of the 550‚àí500 Ma Ross Orogen. I will test our hypothesis in the field by conducting detailed geologic mapping and sample collecting. In subsequent laboratory work we will determine the ages and chemistry of the basement rocks.

Insight From the Himalaya-Tibet System,This research involves target fieldwork aimed at lithotectonic and structural characterization and specimen collection. Detailed structural mapping of faults and shear zones and analysis of spatial variations in strain paths followed by rocks within the Main Central thrust system will follow the approach previously applied by the P.I.‚Äôs to other structures in the Himalaya (e.g. Cottle et al. 2007 2009a b; Kellett & Godin 2009; Kellett et al. 2009 2010; Larson and Godin 2009; Larson et al. 2010a; Jessup & Cottle 2010). Macro- scale structural mapping will include documentation of all standard fabrics with an emphasis on lineations high-strain domains melt-associated deformation as well as boudins flanking structures and over-printing relationships. Shear sense and deformation temperatures will be characterized through both micro-structural analysis (following the methods of e.g. Hirth and Tullis (1992)) and through optical and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis of crystal lattice preferred orientations (LPO) and the asymmetry of [c] and <a> axes patterns in quartz and feldspar grains (following e.g. Law et al. 1990 and Kruhl 1998). Diffraction patterns will be collected using an FEI Quanta 400 FEG scanning electron microscope coupled with a HKL Nordlys 2 EBSD camera at UCSB. Timing constraints on deformation within structures identified in the field will come from U(- Th)-Pb dating of 1) intrusive bodies that either cut or are deformed by the shear zones (Figure 3C); and 2) metamorphic monazite that can be texturally linked to pre- syn- and post-kinematic porphyroblasts (see thermobarometry and metamorphic ages sections). The distribution of deformation domains will provide important information regarding the spatial variations in fabric development during the evolution of the Greater Himalaya series-Main Central thrust system and the relative importance of distributed versus focused (e.g. shear zone) deformation. Within the context of the models proposed Hypothesis 1 predicts that deformation will be concentrated in the vicinity of the major thrust faults. Furthermore deformation temperatures attained would be expected to decrease abruptly down structural section. In contrast Hypothesis 2 predicts that deformation is pervasive throughout the rocks to be examined and that all rocks were deformed at high temperatures; any change in deformation temperature should be gradational. Thus understanding the distribution of deformation and its relative and absolute timing and duration of movement will provide a direct test of the competing models. In either case this study will provide a detailed account of structures including microstructural characteristics and vorticity both of which provide significant constraints on the structural evolution of the Himalayan front.,2011,2015

The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO is the most prominent form of tropical intraseasonal variability in the climate system and has significant influences on the occurrence of extreme precipitation and forecast skills in the medium-to- extended ranges. The main goal of this proposal is to advance our understanding of the influence of the MJO on the predictability of extreme precipitation in the contiguous United States on lead times of 1-14 days during boreal winter. The specific objectives are: I. Examine how the amplitude of the MJO modulates the predictability of extreme precipitation. II. Investigate the relationships between the life cycle of the MJO and predictive skill of extreme precipitation. III. Study the mechanisms by which the MJO influences the predictability of extreme precipitation. The project has two main elements: 1) develop a detailed analysis of the relationships between the MJO and its impact on the predictive skill of extreme precipitation 2) Investigate teleconnection mechanisms by which distinct properties of the MJO may have different impacts on the predictability of extreme precipitation. The proposal will test the hypothesis that variations in the characteristics of the MJO (e.g. amplitude duration and eastward propagation speed primary and successive events phase evolution and El NinÃÉo /Southern Oscillation- ENSO state) have different influences on the predictability of extreme precipitation.,2011,2015

This in turn creates variation in demo- graphic traits ‚Äî the propensity to survive more or less or to have more or fewer offspring (contrast with the actual life history an organism experiences ‚Äî its demographic fate; see Kendall & Fox 2003) as well as individual growth and dispersal rates. While ecologists do use models (like linear matrix models) that classify individuals by age stage or size and sex most assume that in doing so they have captured sufficient variation so that further variation is simply noise of small amplitude. This is not necessarily the case. This variation in traits occurs even when within categories such as age stage size or sex. We use the term ‚Äúdemographic heterogeneity‚Äù to refer collectively to the variation in birth death growth and dispersal rates among individuals in an age stage or size class. Demographic heterogeneity can be produced by various mechanisms including genetic variability(Yashin et al. 1999 Ducrocq et al. 2000 Gerdes et al. 2000 Casellas et al. 2004 Isberg et al. 2006)spatial heterogeneity in the habitat(Gates and Gysel 1978 Boulding and Van Alstyne 1993 Menge et al. 1994 Winter et al. 2000 Franklin et al. 2000 Manolis et al. 2002 Bollinger and Gavin 2004 Landis et al. 2005) unequal allocation of parental care(e.g. Johnstone 2004; Manser&Avey 2000) seed heter- omorphisims(e.g. Silvertown 1984; Venable &Burquez M 1990) maternal family effect (Fox et al. 2006) learned feeding preferences (Bolnick et al. 2003) and social rank (e.g. von Holst Hutzelmeyer &Kaetzke 2002). Demographic heterogeneity is taxonomically widespread. For example heterogeneity in survival has been found in crocodiles (Isberg et al. 2006) baboons (Bronikowski et al. 2002) birds (Wintrebert et al. 2005 Fox et al. 2006) wild plants (Beckage and Clark 2003 Landis et al. 2005) domestic ani- mals(Ducrocq et al. 2000 Casellas et al. 2004) and humans(Yashin et al. 1999 Garibotti et al. 2006) including British aristocrats(Doblhammer and Oeppen 2003). Demographic heterogeneity has been shown to have a variety of effects on population dynamics. Heterogeneity in survival and reproduction can change the population variabliltydue to demographic sto- chasticity often reducing it relative to a homogeneous population with the same average rates. Heterogeneity in survival if it persists throughout the life cycle creates cohort selection which in turn increases the asymptotic population growth rate and equilibrium population densities. Finally heterogeneity in dispersal ability can increase the rate at which an invading population spreads.,2011,2015

For example heterogeneity in survival has been found in crocodiles (Isberg et al. 2006) baboons (Bronikowski et al. 2002) birds (Wintrebert et al. 2005 Fox et al. 2006) wild plants (Beckage and Clark 2003 Landis et al. 2005) domestic ani- mals(Ducrocq et al. 2000 Casellas et al. 2004) and humans(Yashin et al. 1999 Garibotti et al. 2006) including British aristocrats(Doblhammer and Oeppen 2003). Demographic heterogeneity has been shown to have a variety of effects on population dynamics. Heterogeneity in survival and reproduction can change the population variabliltydue to demographic sto- chasticity often reducing it relative to a homogeneous population with the same average rates. Hetero- geneity in survival if it persists throughout the life cycle creates cohort selection which in turn increases the asymptotic population growth rate and equilibrium population densities. Finally heterogeneity in dispersal ability can increase the rate at which an invading population spreads. ,2011,2015
249p,Douglas Burbank Bodo Bookhagen,8/1/11,7/31/15,275006,National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,1050070,The Pamir Frontal Thrust System: Rates Style and Controls on Deformation,Our goals include defining how where and at what rates shortening has been accommodated within the Pamir-Tian Shan structural corridor and exploring the extent to which erosion by an axial river modulates shortening rates on faults proximal to the river. We will focus our work along the axis of the structural corridor where we can examine a rich suite of along- strike structural variability in the style orientation and (likely) rate of deformation. The Pamir Frontal Thrust (PFT) is the leading edge of the Pamir orogen. In reality some apparently Pamir-related faults occur to the north of the PFT including nearby faults that ruptured in the 1985 M7.4 Wuqia earthquake [Feng et al. 1988]. Within the study area the PFT tends to be localized within lower Paleogene gypsum beds and it typically carries the entire Cenozoic stratigraphic succession (up to 8 km thick) in its hanging wall. Where the PFT is exposed in the Bozi Tage Range near the Kezilesu River it tends to be a low-angle thrust dipping from 0¬∞ to 15¬∞. Ongoing slip on the PFT is evidenced by offset talus slopes that show fresh scarps. Typically the PFT slices across the Xiyu conglomerate an upper Cenozoic time-transgressive fluvial conglomerate that ranges in age from 16 to 0 Ma within the foreland [Heermance et al. 2007] but which is less than 1.6 Ma where it has been paleomagnetically dated a few kilometers north of the PFT in the corridor [Chen et al. 2005]. On the eastern margin of the Mayikake Basin the PFT cuts nearly horizontally across a 50¬∞-dipping 3-km-thick panel of Xiyu conglomerate for about 4 kilometers.,2011,2015

In addition to the highly seasonal summer rainfall winter precipitation is important for snowmelt and discharge in the pre-monsoon (spring) season. Runoff from snow is especially significant in the central Asian and western Himalayan regions where hundreds of millions of people reside but observation understanding and prediction of terrestrial water storage and fluxes remain poorly understood. Quantification of seasonal amounts of rain snow glacial and snowmelt waters and associated physical processes are largely unknown despite their importance to pre-monsoon and dry-season water for irrigation drinking and power generation. The main goal of this project is to advance our current understanding of climate processes on regional-to-continental scales and how they affect the water balance in the High Asia Mountains. The project focuses on multiannual-to-decadal variations in the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) and winter western disturbances (WD) and their impacts on rainfall snow and runoff variability in High Asia. The project will focus on three specific objectives: I. Characterize and investigate multi-annual-to-decadal variations in the Indian Summer Monsoon and western disturbances and their regional impacts on the surface water budget in the High Asia Mountains. II. Examine the spatiotemporal variability of the surface water budget including changes in rainfall and snow and their relative roles in driving runoff variations in High Asia. III. Develop case studies to investigate changes in Indian Summer Monsoon and western disturbances seasons and their influences on the long-term variability of snow and associated runoff in the High Asia Mountains. Changes in the Indian Summer Monsoon and western disturbances include extremely wet/dry monsoon seasons high/low frequency and precipitation intensity of winter storms and teleconnections associated with warm/cold El NinÃÉo/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases.,2011,2015

Estimates using eddy covariance techniques which provide 30 minute averages are difficult because the footprint over which measurements are made can extend over land. In our proposed work (DEB-0919603) we suggested using sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and sampling in response to changing meteorology. However both Vachon et al. (2010) and Cole et al. (2010) use chamber methods which they indicate can be or are corrected for the chamber induced accentuation of turbulence at the air-water interface. Using these chambers and sampling over short intervals over diel cycles opens the door for diel assessments of k600 using inversion techniques as in MacIntyre et al. (in press). Our approach for developing valid equations for k600 in small lakes over diel cycles will be to combine these short interval flux measurements with diel measurements of temperature meteorology surface currents and pCO2. Given the predicted importance of global warming in the Arctic for mobilizing carbon stores and previous evidence that freshwaters contribute significantly to terrestrial carbon budgets in the Arctic (Kling et al. 1992) our measurements in summer 2011 will be performed in two small arctic lakes near the Toolik Field Station. Lake N2 has a surface area of 1.6 ha is 10 m deep and seasonally stratifies and Lake E6 is polymictic 1.9 ha in surface area and maximally 3 m deep. We will obtain time series temperature and meteorological measurements measurements of currents with acoustic Doppler profilers and acoustic Doppler velocimeters measurements of exchange of SF6 introduced near bottom or in the metalimnion and the epilimnion as a proxy for green house gases measurements of pCO2 concentrations in surface waters and air using a LiCor 820 and equilibrator and measurements of gas concentrations in chambers. We will obtain profiles to compute turbulence using the self-contained autonomous micro- profiler (SCAMP). We have experience with all but the chamber measurements and willdevelop that expertise before leaving for the field. The research team includes the PI the co-PI Jordan Clark who is an expert with SF6 and two postdoctoral fellows with experience in physical limnology and physical-biological coupling. Within the overarching goal of quantifying the physical limnology of small lakes and developing equations for the gas transfer coefficient for these lakes intermediate goals include determining the extent of damping of turbulence during windy periods with heating; quantifying turbulence during periods of cooling; quantifying current speeds the shear induced and the persistence of these currents; and validating predicted shear stresses and heat loss from sheltered lakes. ,2009,2015

Second we will use the information gained in this first part of the project to plan and carry out a sampling and measurement scheme most likely to yield a record of centennial variability in 10Be fallout flux that can be matched to the 10Be flux record from the Greenland ice cores. Measurement of bulk 10Be in NAVC sediments: The specific analytical tasks in this project include locating and obtaining samples of NAVC sediments subsampling them for 10Be analysis and measuring 10Be concentrations by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). Our primary source of samples will be an extensive archive of cores of NAVC sediments that PI Ridge has collected over many years and that are stored at Tufts University. One important aspect of this part of the project however is to ensure that subsamples are not cross-contaminated or contaminated with modern 10Be during collection. This requirement may restrict use of archived cores that are highly fractured or otherwise difficult to sample cleanly. If we can not obtain the samples we need from this archive we will revisit source outcrops and collect new samples typically by collecting short cores from outcrops using a hammered-PVC-pipe procedure that Ridge has employed for many years. Ridge will have primary responsibility for locating archived and new sample material and correlating it to the NAVC although students will also be closely involved in this process and all project personnel will participate. 10Be concentrations are measured by an isotope dilution method in which a 9Be carrier is added to the sample the entire sample is digested and the Be extracted and the Be isotope ratio is measured by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). All aspects of this process are proven reliable and efficient. We will carry out Be extraction from sediments in a purpose-built chemistry laboratory at the University of Vermont (see Facilities and Resources) using a total-fusion method described by Stone (1996) and further refined during the past few years by Balco Bierman and Biermans students. At the 10Be concentrations we expect to measure in this project (> 107 atoms g?1) AMS measurement is rapid (a few minutes per sample) and precise (?1-2% analytical uncertainty). Research focus 1: systematics of 10Be deposition in varved sediments. We will use several strategies in the first part of the project. First we will investigate how 10Be is delivered to glacial and nonglacial varved sediments. We hypothesize that 10Be deposition is seasonally focused due to effects such as more effective scavenging by fine sediment during winter suppression of fallout 10Be delivery to the lake during winter due to snow and ice cover and the strong overall seasonality of sediment transport and deposition. We will investigate this by characterizing 10Be concentrations and their variability within both summer and winter layers to investigate seasonal effects as well as laterally within a single varve to investigate the effect of sediment source variation between direct glacial sediment and runoff from the landscape. Understanding which if any of these processes are important may suggest means to preferentially sample fallout 10Be rather than recycled 10Be. Second we will determine whether or not short-period solar variability in particular the diagnostic 11-year Schwabe cycle is present. As noted in many ice-core studies (Beer et al. 1994; Yiou et al. 1997; Steig et al. 1998) observing the 11-year cycle in a 10Be concentration record clearly shows that 10Be fallout variations are recorded (the reverse is not necessarily true: if we did not observe the 11-year cycle it could signal only that it was suppressed by a multi-year residence time for fallout 10Be in the lake and catchment which would not affect recording of centennial-scale variability). Analytical work for this part of the project will require approximately 90 10Be measurements including paired summer and winter analyses on a number of glacial and nonglacial sections (approx. 40 analyses) and analyses of at least two short continuous sections at a resolution adequate to observe the 11-year period (e.g. two-year spacing over a 50-year period; 50 samples). Research focus 2: generating a long 10Be flux record suitable for correlation. In the second part of the project we will choose a section of the NAVC from which to generate a long 10Be record with resolution appropriate to matching the centennial-scale variations in 10Be flux observed in the Greenland ice cores and then generate this record. At present absent any new information we may gain from the first part of the project described above we think the nonglacial varve section at Newbury is the most likely section of the NAVC to yield such a record for three reasons. First varves are relatively thin which limits dilution of the fallout signal. Second centennial-scale variations in 10Be flux during this time interval are suitable for correlation at the needed precision as demonstrated by Muscheler et al. (2008). Third this section is one of the longest continuous sections in the NAVC which permits us to generate as long a record as possible from a single site: this avoids any potential complications related to patching together 10Be records from multiple locations within the lake system. ,2011,2015

Such strength plays a key role in shaping landscapes resisting erosive processes and modulating landslide hazards. The key factor however is not the strength of intact rock but rather the effective strength of the entire rock-mass at the surface where it interacts with climatic topographic and biotic variables.

To accomplish this we will study erosion patterns in and around deep canyons on the Colorado Plateau in relation to channel steepness patterns and rock properties. Important to our approach is the concept that the spatial structure of short-term erosion rates in disequilibrium landscapes like the Colorado Plateau reflects the longer-term temporal history of mainstem river incision. Not only do the canyons and surrounding landscapes of the Colorado Plateau provide an excellent natural laboratory for this investigation but their study also carries significant broader impact and public education potential because of the iconic status of the Grand Canyon and the recent high profile debate over the antiquity of this dramatic landform (age estimates range from <6 Ma to >60 Ma). Despite the fundamental and long-recognized importance of lithology in landscape evolution it has received little attention in the quantitative studies of landscape evolution in recent decades. Partly this is because we have lacked the ability to quantitatively measure rock strength at the process scale and partly because until recently lacked firm theory to relate rock properties to river incision processes ‚Äì limitations that can now be overcome. We address three fundamental problems of broad interest to Geologists and Geomorphologists: (1) the role of lithology in river incision and landscape evolution in general (2) how lithologic variability affects and limits our ability to interpret river incision history from study of landforms and (3) the controversial incision history of river canyons in the Colorado Plateau. The back drop to our study is the enigmatic Late Cenozoic exhumation history of the Colorado Plateau but although our results should contribute to solving this long-standing problem it is not our focus. We frame our study around three testable hypotheses concerning the fundamental controls on landscape evolution encoded in canyon landscapes and the last ~1 Myr of river incision history. Given the icon nature of the Grand Canyon and the vast number of tourists that visit the canyon each year public education is essential especially when geoscience educators use National Parks as case studies for teaching exercises. As part of this research we will pursue a geoscience education study (part of the graduate student‚Äôs time commitment) of the effectiveness of using field analogs to teach about geologic process and landscape evolution specifically related to canyon incision and relief generation. Folks living on reservation land on the Colorado Plateau are a key target audience. In addition to our public outreach efforts the proposed study will provide significant training for one graduate student and several undergraduates. All students will interact with the PIs and institutions providing educational experiences for each student that are not typical. Specifically this research will enhance the opportunities for undergraduates for direct involvement in cutting-edge research. We will proactively recruit women and underrepresented minorities.,2013,2015

Because of the acute reduction in vegetation and organic matter soils burned by fire lose cohesion and infiltration capacity. Along with enhanced soil water repellency runoff and flooding potential are elevated years after fire. Post-fire hydrologic and sedimentologic responses are extremely complex varying with burn severity rainfall regimes geophysical characteristics and vegetation recovery. Although researchers have studied these processes for more than 70 years predicting post-fire effects remains elusive and physically-based models of post-fire runoff and erosion are not yet complete. Part of the difficulty is that temporal windows for observing post-fire effects are comparatively short with direct measurements tending to span only part of the recovery period (typically less than three years). Equally important are longer-term perspectives however in regards to how wildfire impacts Earth surface processes in the context of landscape evolution. Developing predictive understanding of both short- and long-term effects is critical to the future of our planet especially in an era of changing climates that have increased frequencies and magnitudes of wildfires. This proposed RAPID project focuses on production and delivery of dry ravel a characteristic and immediate post-fire response on steep slopes in the western USA. Dry ravel is a dry-season erosion process whereby gravel sediment moving down hillslopes by gravity becomes trapped by vegetation. Burning vegetation releases this sediment enabling its accumulation at margins of ephemeral channels. Dry ravel therefore provides a significant source of sediment into river channels after fire in chaparral environments. The investigators will quantify the volume of dry ravel sediment derived from the recent Springs Fire that burned Big Sycamore Canyon in southern California during May 2013 Using Terrestrial LiDAR scanning (TLS) augmented by field surveys. Additionally the investigators have geomorphic data spanning over 25 years for Big Sycamore Canyon and two comparable basins nearby with different fire histories. Thus comparing the dry ravel processes at these three sites will enable a compelling story of both short- and long-term sediment dynamics following wildfire in chaparral environments. These data are critical toward developing models of the dynamics of dry ravel for further development and testing.,2013,2015

However the two longest-lived Pacific hotspot tracks the Hawaiian-Emperor and Louisville seamount chains exhibit hard-to-explain differences in behavior prior to 45 Ma: (i) The Hawaiian-Emperor show a pronounced ‚Äúkink‚Äù while the Louisville chain is gently curved and (ii) while the Louisville hotspot likely remained geographically fixed (results of recent IODP Expedition 330) Hawaii drifted 15¬∞ south. Differences in hotspot fixity may arise from ridge capture and ridge-related flow modifying plume upwelling the mantle wind tilting plumes movement of the plume base or large-scale reorganizations of tectonic plates affecting global mantle flow. As a result these complicating processes diminish the accuracy of APM models for the Pacific Plate in particular and our understanding of mantle dynamics in general. We propose that adding a third long-lived Pacific hotspot track can help to deconvolve the effects of plate versus plume motions. Recent evidence suggests that the Rurutu hotspot is long-lived (~100 Ma) follows a hotspot track midway between Hawaii and Louisville and shows a pronounced 155¬∞ bend like Hawaii between 35-55 Ma. Combining Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf geochemical and 40Ar/39Ar age data will allow us to test the hypothesis that the Rurutu hotspot is both geochemically continuous and and possibly the longest-lived hotspot in the Pacific. We propose to obtain new age and geochemical data for the critical region around the poorly characterized Rurutu hotspot bend. This data will help define a third Pacific hotspot track that will help deconvolve plate from plume motions between 40 and 80 Ma. Specifically we propose to test the following two hypotheses: (1) The Rurutu hotspot is a long-lived geochemically-distinct hotspot like the Hawaiian and Louisville hotspots; and (2) the Rurutu hotspot exhibits a pronounced bend and the timing of the Rurutu bend matches the timing of the (pronounced) Hawaii-Emperor and (less pronounced) Louisville bends at ~50 Ma. To test these hypotheses we propose to: (1) Dredge 20 key volcanoes at the Rurutu hotspot bend--defined by the intersection of the Tuvalu and Samoa chains--to determine its precise location and timing; (2) Geochemically characterize 60 samples to evaluate a link to the modern-day Rurutu hotspot; (3) Compare the predicted Rurutu age progression from various APM models to 45 new 40Ar/39Ar ages to be measured from these seamounts. This data from the Rurutu hotspot will allow us to trace the longest-lived hotspot in the Pacific and construct an APM model for the Pacific Plate that is less sensitive to plume motion.

Recent evidence suggests that the Rurutu hotspot is long-lived (~100 Ma) follows a hotspot track midway between Hawaii and Louisville and shows a pronounced 155° bend like Hawaii between 35-55 Ma. Combining Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf geochemical and 40Ar/39Ar age data will allow us to test the hypothesis that the Rurutu hotspot is both geochemically continuous and and possibly the longest-lived hotspot in the Pacific. We propose to obtain new age and geochemical data for the critical region around the poorly characterized Rurutu hotspot bend. This data will help define a third Pacific hotspot track that will help deconvolve plate from plume motions between 40 and 80 Ma. Specifically we propose to test the following two hypotheses: (1) The Rurutu hotspot is a long-lived geochemically-distinct hotspot like the Hawaiian and Louisville hotspots; and (2) the Rurutu hotspot exhibits a pronounced bend and the timing of the Rurutu bend matches the timing of the (pronounced) Hawaii-Emperor and (less pronounced) Louisville bends at ~50 Ma. To test these hypotheses we propose to: (1) Dredge 20 key volcanoes at the Rurutu hotspot bend--defined by the intersection of the Tuvalu and Samoa chains--to determine its precise location and timing; (2) Geochemically characterize 60 samples to evaluate a link to the modern-day Rurutu hotspot; (3) Compare the predicted Rurutu age progression from various APM models to 45 new 40Ar/39Ar ages to be measured from these seamounts. This data from the Rurutu hotspot will allow us to trace the longest-lived hotspot in the Pacific and construct an APM model for the Pacific Plate that is less sensitive to plume motion. The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) is a Hispanic Serving Institution and the only US research-intensive doctoral university with a Mexican-American majority student population. We will recruit the most promising undergraduate students from PIs classes taught at UTEP Boston University (BU) and Oregon State University (OSU). We will bring 9 nine undergraduate students on the cruise including an IDES (Increasing Diversity in Earth Sciences) undergraduate student from OSU Furthermore the project will support three graduate students who will gain seagoing experience and will work on the sample suite at their respective home institutions. At sea we will organize four outreach activities: (1) run a real-time cruise website (2) produce new bathymetric maps for the Seamount Catalog (http://earthref.org) (3) organize an at-sea seminar series for the further education of the nine undergraduate students and (4) provide compositional analysis training for the undergraduates using a portable LIBS (Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy) system. Finally the nature of the research will foster the ongoing collaboration between the research programs at UTEP BU and OSU where the funding helps to support their analytical facilities. This project will also support 2 young investigators (Konter Jackson). ,2013,2015

The Royal Society Range lies approximately 90km ESE of McMurdo Station in the TransAntarctic Mountains while the Darwin Glacier area is 200 km SW from McMurdo Station immediately north of the Byrd Glacier. I hypothesize that these two areas represent the northern and southern boundaries (respectively) of a geologically distinct segment within the southern Victoria Land sector of the 550?500 Ma Ross Orogen. I will test our hypothesis in the field by conducting detailed geologic mapping and sample collecting. In subsequent laboratory work we will determine the ages and chemistry of the basement rocks. These two datasets combined will thus build up a more complete picture of the geologic evolution of this part of the TransAntacrtic Mountains. ,2011,2015

The proposed research will develop new understanding of the interplay between hydrology, sediment transport/storage, and biogeochemistry. The project is designed so that this new knowledge can be generalized and readily transferred to a wide range of fluvial systems beset by sediment-adsorbed contaminants. The study will focus on the longitudinal (downstream) transport and biogeochemical processing of sediment-adsorbed Hg derived from hydraulic gold mining in the Sierra Nevada and mercury mining in the Coast Ranges within and through the Yuba-Feather-Sacramento River system of Northern California, USA. It will document the primary sources (Coast Range v. Sierra Nevada) of Hg contamination to lowland ecosystems in the Sacramento Valley and Bay-Delta and the relative contribution and risks of each. It will challenge conventional wisdom by assessing how Hg bioavailability changes along sediment 191 transport pathways, irrespective of total Hg concentrations, and by identifying/quantifying the controlling processes at the intersection of sedimentation/inundation and biogeochemical modifications of Hg speciation. The proposed work will: 1) mathematically model flood inundation in river corridors to identify areas of high potential of oxidation/reduction; 2) identify preferential zones of sedimentation through numerical modeling of eventbased washload transport and interpret relative sediment deposit age via a detailed and spatially extensive library of sedimentary histories from prior work; 3) identify distinct contamination sources to lowlands by conducting Hg stable isotopic analysis of sediment; and 4) investigate Hg speciation and reactivity in conjunction with changes in Hg species isotopic signatures, associated with redox conditions, sediment source, and ambient chemistry.",2013,2015

However the fate of the subducted package--oceanic crust and sediment--in the mantle is poorly understood. A long-standing hypothesis maintains that subducted materials residue in the mantle for an extended but unknown period of time and are then recycled back to the Earth's surface in regions of buoyantly upwelling mantle and melted beneath hotspots. If this hypothesis is correct ocean island basalts (OIB) erupted at hotspots should exhibit geochemical signatures associated with the crustal protoliths that were injected into the mantle at a subduction zone in the geologic past. However it has been difficult to unequivocally detect geochemical signatures of ancient subducted materials in hotspot lavas. This project will use measurements of mass independently fractionated sulfur (MIF-S) isotope signatures--made using two complementary techniques--in key hotspot lavas to trace crustal cycling from the surface through the mantle and back again. ,2014,2015
267p,Ralph Archuleta,1/1/15,12/31/15,38006,National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,1449275,Numerical Modeling of Earthquake Motions: Waves and Ruptures,Numerical simulation of rupture propagation and seismic waves is an essential tool for investigating earthquake physics and refining the velocity structure of the Earth. The physics of earthquake ruptures is a complex phenomenon involving the constitutive law for sliding friction (with many different processes e.g. temperature pressure slip and slip rate affecting the friction) along with a medium that may behave elastically or plastically. The fault itself has an inherent roughness at all scales. There is simply too few data by which one can constrain the physics of an earthquake rupture. The earthquake rupture being complex produces a complex radiated field which is poorly sampled by the arrays of seismic instruments. Because one cannot directly observe an earthquake  the complex evolution of slip on a fault which is buried within the Earth to depths of 100s of kilometers  a primary question is what data can constrain the numerical models? Thus the participants in the workshop will be considering both forward modeling of earthquakes and inversion methods by which properties of the earthquake source are inferred. The approaches are complementary; both depend on the elastic and attenuation properties of the Earth. Because of uncertainties in the properties of the Earth as well as the spatial-temporal distribution of stresses on the fault there are tradeoffs between what is considered a property of the source and what is a property of the Earth. The discussion in a focused workshop allows those who have experience with these problems to discuss how the different methods might lead to better constraints on the source and propagation. This would lead to better numerical simulations and hence more realistic ground motion estimates from future earthquakes. ,2015,2015

Biophysical models consisting of ocean circulation models combined with Lagrangian particle tracking are now widely used to provide insights into the spatial and temporal dynamics of larval connectivity that remain unobtainable through empirical approaches. However many of the biological assumptions used to characterize larval life history in these models are quite general and the impacts of these assumptions have yet to be rigorously tested. Our goal in this proposal is to quantify How important are the details of larval biology in estimates of connectivity and long-term population dynamics? To answer this question we propose to study the spatial and temporal impacts of larval biological factors on site-to-site connectivity and long- term population growth using a biophysical model for nearshore species in the Southern California Bight (SCB). Four major larval biological factors will be investigated: (1) temperature effects on larval growth maturation and mortality (2) vertical swimming behavior (3) spatial/temporal variability in larval production and (4) role of habitat on settlement. Using a biophysical model of the SCB differences in larval connectivity due to the biological factors will be assessed statistically by comparing connectivity estimates that incorporate the additional biological factors to a baseline of connectivity estimates calculated from passive neutrally buoyant particles. We will also employ a spatial demographic model driven by the connectivity estimates to quantify the influence of biological factors on long-term population dynamics. The proposed work will generate significant insights into the various aspects of larval biology that are critical for determining larval connectivity and for projecting population dynamics into the future. The results of this project will improve the credible application of biophysical modeling approaches to scientific studies of coastal species as well as to marine spatial planning and -fisheries management. ,2012,2016

The structure of the ophiolite makes it clear that the crust formed in an extensional environment similar to modern fast-spreading mid-ocean ridges making it an invaluable resource for studying MOR processes. However many researchers have also highlighted important differences between the Oman-U.A.E. ophiolite and modern ridges including geochemical differences between MOR basalts and extrusive lavas in the ophiolite and the presence of multiple generations of plutonism and volcanism within the mantle and crust. To determine how observations from the ophiolite can be applied to modern spreading centers it is necessary to understand the tectonic setting during formation and emplacement of the ophiolite. The Principal Investigator recently completed an extensive U-Pb zircon geochronology and Nd isotope study of the ophiolite. The results from this study together with previous work by other researchers suggest that the age and composition of magmatism that post-dates formation of the ophiolite crust can provide important new insight into the tectonic history of the ophiolite. The proposed research would target three series of rocks: silicic sills and dikes in the mantle with Nd isotopic ratios that are distinct from the ophiolite crust; intrusive and extrusive rocks in the crust that post date the main phase of crustal growth; and leucocratic melts and amphibolite to granulite facies metamorphic rocks from the metamorphic sole. The distinct isotopic and geochemical compositions of the first two series are likely related to development of a thrust fault or subduction zone below the ophiolite. Initial U-Pb zircons dates from these rocks are <0.10.25 Ma younger than the ophiolite crust. Further high precision geochronology and geochemical analyses including Nd and Hf isotopic analyses will map out the spatial and temporal development of subduction or thrusting along the length of the ophiolite. High-precision U-Pb zircon geochronology and geochemistry of the metamorphic sole will provide complementary information on conditions in the under thrust slab. This project will provide fundamental new insight into the tectonic development of the Oman-U.A.E. ophiolite and place direct temporal constraints on models of ophiolite genesis.,2013,2016

During subduction a series of progressive devolatilization reactions release fluid from the slab. Some of these fluids enter the overlying mantle wedge and trigger melting that in turn leads to arc volcanism. While it is clear that fluids play an important role in the dynamics of subduction zones the precise fluid pathways remain unclear. Details of the fluid budget the location of dehydration events and the precise role of fluids in triggering intermediate-depth seismicity also remain unquantified.

273p,Joshua Schimel Patricia Holden,5/1/12,4/30/16,607635,National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,DEB-1145875,Collaborative Research: Controls over C Sequestration: Physiology vs. Physics,In this project we will focus on an annual grassland to evaluate the mechanisms that regulate the fate of C. Grasslands in California cover over 10 million hectares (Jackson 1985) are dominated by annual grasses and are important ecosystems in the State. However we have found comparable microbial dynamics in California grassland and Bishop pine forest so we have confidence that the mechanisms we evaluate occur in other ecosystem types as well. The research will take place at the UCSB Sedgwick Reserve which is located 50 km from the coast in the Santa Ynez Valley (43o42??30????N 120o2??30????W). The climate is Mediterranean and characteristic of interior California with hot dry summers and cool wet winters. Average rainfall is 380 mm/yr but varies widely; El Niño years are notably rainy. The soils are pachic argixerolls in valley bottoms and typic argixerolls on slopes. The vegetation is dominated by Mediterranean annual grasses including Bromus diandrus B. hordaceous and Avena fatua. Our main site will be in the Figueroa watershed previously studied by Schimel and Holden. Analyzing the mechanisms involved requires controlled microcosm experiments that will be described below but to explore how these mechanisms regulate how varying plant C inputs and moisture influence soil C storage we propose a field experiment in which we modify: 1) plant C- inputs during the growing season (by thinning) and 2) the length of the dry season (by watering & rainout shelters). We will establish 3 blocks of 16 plots each (1 m x 1m) and establish a factorial design in which we create gradients of plant inputs and the length of the summer drought. We will use modeling to integrate between the micro- and macro-scales. To modify plant inputs we will thin plots by hand to remove either 1/3 2/3 or all the biomass (plus a control). Plots will be established initially after plants germinate in the fall of 2012 and new sprouts will be removed weekly or as necessary to maintain these approximate proportions. Soil moisture is likely to vary as transpiration losses will be lower in the thinned plots but surface evaporation may partially compensate. Importantly annual grasses senescence and die shortly after seed-set not when the soils dry out. Thus at the beginning of the summer there will be a suite of plots with different amounts of dead roots to serve as substrate within the soils with relatively similar moisture conditions (depending on the timing of spring rainfall). Dry-down after senescence will be purely by evaporation. Moisture manipulations will include control lengthened summer drought shortened drought and no drought. To extend the drought we will build rainout shelters to prevent rewetting during the winter following the thinning treatments. To shorten the drought we will use weekly drip irrigation. The goal is not to keep soils constantly wet but to mimic episodic precipitation and prevent soils from drying fully. The short-drought treatment will be irrigated into July then allowed to dry normally roughly halving the length of the typical drought. The no-drought treatment will be watered into October. We will regularly weed the watered-plots during the summer to remove new sprouts. Soil moisture will be monitored continuously (using soil moisture probes and dataloggers) in the experimental plots. Soil samples will be collected from all treatments to analyze C dynamics at four points through the year: 1) At peak live plant biomass late in the growing season (April/May) 2) early summer (just before the short-drought watering ends; late June) 3) midsummer (August) and 4) the end of the dry season (October or early January for the extended drought treatment). We will collect samples from the top 10 cm and analyze the essential C pools including roots light and heavy fraction OM microbial biomass etc. As these measures will be coupled to the work specifically testing the research hypotheses we describe the details of those analyses in those sections. The field sampling will assess how environmental factors (C-supply and moisture) regulate C-pools and microbial activities and the begin identifying the mechanisms connecting them. We will couple these to laboratory incubation studies to tease apart the specific mechanisms. ,2012,2016

We plan to use ~30 10Be analyses to undertake a low-resolution sampling of the 1-12 Ma portion of the section at a density of ~1 sample per 330 Myr. We plan to use several 10Be samples on modern sediment and divide the remaining 10Be samples between two sections of the stratigraphy that show the best opportunity for developing a high-resolution record of paleo-erosion rates. Such sections will be characterized by well-resolved paleomagnetic reversals anchored by new tephrachronology with high-resolution U- Pb zircon ages. As mentioned above we will likely focus on a 1.2-Myr interval between 7.4  6.2 Ma which is currently bracketed by two ashes and contains 7 reversals. Nine additional samples in this interval would provide a resolution of ~1 sample per 100 kyr capable of resolving 400-kyr cyclicity. An additional 11 samples would then be collected from a ~100 kyr long interval allowing a nominal resolution of ~8.3 kyr per sample capable of resolving variations as short as 23 ka. For comparison we would like to repeat the above sampling strategy on a ~ 1-Myr-long interval in the late Pliocene/early Pleistocene after the onset of northern hemisphere glaciation at ~ 2.8 Ma. The 20 additional 10Be samples focused on this interval would be paired with 26Al and 21Ne analyses in the same samples in an effort to implement the full 3-isotope approach described above. 5-10 of these 21Ne analyses will be paired with 10Be samples to develop a cross-calibration and compute nucleogenic 21Ne whereas the remaining 10-15 21Ne samples will be used to extend the low-resolution record back as far as 12 Ma. ,2012,2016

However our understanding of this fundamental process remains limited. Can we use geological observations in some particularly well-exposed suture zones to make general statements about how landscapes and sedimentary basins evolve during suturing? What geodynamic processes lead to decreases in plate convergence rate? Are Mediterranean-style rollback of remnant oceanic lithosphere and opening of marginal oceanic basins characteristic of all or most pre-climax collision zones? Do presuturing ophiolite obduction and intraoceanic arccontinental margin interactions leave predictable signatures in suture zones? How is the upper continental plate preconditioned by pre-suturing tectonism and how does the upper plate evolve during the transition from oceanic to continental subduction? Is there a predictable mode of deformation in the downgoing continental plate? And what do we expect the balance to be among continental subduction and erosive removal of mass from a collisional orogenic system? We propose to address such questions through a 4-year investigation of the archetypal IndiaAsia collision zone (IACZ) in southern Tibet that involves 19 investigators and 14 graduate students from 9 different institutions. Techniques to be employed include structural geology stratigraphy geochronology thermochronology stable and radiogenic isotope geochemistry igneous and metamorphic petrology paleomagnetism and geodynamical modeling. We aim to determine the: (1) evolution of paleogeography and paleoelevation during the transition from oceanic subduction to mature continental collision; (2) geodynamic processes that caused marked decreases in IndiaAsia convergence rate; (3) role of Mediterranean-style opening and closing of marginal basins prior to terminal collision; (4) metamorphic evolution of lower-plate (Indian) rocks in response to ophiolite emplacement possible intra-oceanic arc collision and continent collision; (5) role of pre-collisional Andean-style magmatism and deformation in preconditioning the upper-plate lithosphere and how this Andean-style system evolved during continent collision; (6) paleogeography of the Neo-Tethys margins and the history of subduction exhumation thickening and underthrusting/rollback of Greater Indian continental lithosphere; and (7) spatial pattern magnitude and history of erosion and sediment dispersal. Our aims are ambitious but feasible because of the presence of rich but as yet untapped geological records of appropriate age (Cretaceous to Miocene) adjacent to and within the IndiaAsia suture zone. Geodynamical modeling of suturing processes will run in parallel with the geological studies; this vital effort will help guide the evolving project. Whereas the IACZ will be used as our lab we expect that our project deliverables (3-D pre- syn- and post-suturing reconstructions at the lithosphere scale) will provide fresh well-constrained and testable ideas about the suturing process and its role in continental crustal genesis. ,2011,2016

Microenvironments have played critical roles in rapid vegetation response to past climate change such as the emergence from the last glacial maximum. This project tests the importance of these difficult-to-model features in vegetation response to future climate change. The overarching research question addressed is """"How does macroecological response to climate change emerge from finer scale climate and population processes?"" The project uses a combination of modeling and field experimentation to answer this question. A collaborative research team will model microenvironment impacts on species distribution abundance and diversity under rapid climate change for four tree species across four study sites in the Sierra Nevada and Coast Ranges of California. This proposed research design is a novel combination of site trials distribution models and population models incorporating measured (rather than inferred) species' tolerances relevant to microenvironments at scales that vary over five orders of magnitude (30m-3000km). Analytical tools will include reciprocal transplant experiments field surveys species trait-based distribution models population models and biogeographic models of climate change. Physical models of microenvironments are linked to models of tree species occupation of microenvironments which in turn inform models of population-level responses. Climate change is simulated using Regional Earth Systems Models and statistical downscaling from global climate model simulations. Field experiments examine the response of establishment phase (seedling) dynamics the life history stage most sensitive to altered climate through transplanting protocols to lower (warmer) elevations. The frequency of fire in the landscape is projected using correlations of fire to landscape conditions under current climate. Establishment phase and fire information is then used in models of single species population responses and multi-taxa responses in complex landscapes. These population-level models will give clear indication of whether microenvironments change species dynamics in rapid climate change in ways that will dramatically change range-wide and continental-scale biological responses to climate change.",2011,2016

Insight From the Himalaya-Tibet System,This research involves target fieldwork aimed at lithotectonic and structural characterization and specimen collection. Detailed structural mapping of faults and shear zones and analysis of spatial variations in strain paths followed by rocks within the Main Central thrust system will follow the approach previously applied by the P.I.s to other structures in the Himalaya (e.g. Cottle et al. 2007 2009a b; Kellett & Godin 2009; Kellett et al. 2009 2010; Larson and Godin 2009; Larson et al. 2010a; Jessup & Cottle 2010). Macro- scale structural mapping will include documentation of all standard fabrics with an emphasis on lineations high-strain domains melt-associated deformation as well as boudins flanking structures and over-printing relationships. Shear sense and deformation temperatures will be characterized through both micro-structural analysis (following the methods of e.g. Hirth and Tullis (1992)) and through optical and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis of crystal lattice preferred orientations (LPO) and the asymmetry of [c] and <a> axes patterns in quartz and feldspar grains (following e.g. Law et al. 1990 and Kruhl 1998). Diffraction patterns will be collected using an FEI Quanta 400 FEG scanning electron microscope coupled with a HKL Nordlys 2 EBSD camera at UCSB. Timing constraints on deformation within structures identified in the field will come from U(- Th)-Pb dating of 1) intrusive bodies that either cut or are deformed by the shear zones (Figure 3C); and 2) metamorphic monazite that can be texturally linked to pre- syn- and post-kinematic porphyroblasts (see thermobarometry and metamorphic ages sections). The distribution of deformation domains will provide important information regarding the spatial variations in fabric development during the evolution of the Greater Himalaya series-Main Central thrust system and the relative importance of distributed versus focused (e.g. shear zone) deformation. Within the context of the models proposed Hypothesis 1 predicts that deformation will be concentrated in the vicinity of the major thrust faults. Furthermore deformation temperatures attained would be expected to decrease abruptly down structural section. In contrast Hypothesis 2 predicts that deformation is pervasive throughout the rocks to be examined and that all rocks were deformed at high temperatures; any change in deformation temperature should be gradational. Thus understanding the distribution of deformation and its relative and absolute timing and duration of movement will provide a direct test of the competing models. In either case this study will provide a detailed account of structures including microstructural characteristics and vorticity both of which provide significant constraints on the structural evolution of the Himalayan front. ,2011,2016

The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO is the most prominent form of tropical intraseasonal variability in the climate system and has significant influences on the occurrence of extreme precipitation and forecast skills in the medium-to-extended ranges. The main goal of this proposal is to advance our understanding of the influence of the MJO on the predictability of extreme precipitation in the contiguous United States on lead times of 1-14 days during boreal winter. The specific objectives are: I. Examine how the amplitude of the MJO modulates the predictability of extreme precipitation. II. Investigate the relationships between the life cycle of the MJO and predictive skill of extreme precipitation. III. Study the mechanisms by which the MJO influences the predictability of extreme precipitation. The project has two main elements: 1) develop a detailed analysis of the relationships between the MJO and its impact on the predictive skill of extreme precipitation 2) Investigate teleconnection mechanisms by which distinct properties of the MJO may have different impacts on the predictability of extreme precipitation. The proposal will test the hypothesis that variations in the characteristics of the MJO (e.g. amplitude duration and eastward propagation speed primary and successive events phase evolution and El Niño /Southern Oscillation- ENSO state) have different influences on the predictability of extreme precipitation. ,2011,2016

There is however uncertainty about how to quantify the influence of many factors— including rock composition temperature grain size strain fluid activity and/or degree of melting—on flow of the continental crust at high temperature and pressure. This proposal presents an unusual opportunity to test which factors permitted or inhibited the flow of continental crust at high pressure and temperature in a well-understood orogen. ,2012,2016
280p,James Frew,8/1/13,7/31/16,250364,National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,1302236,III: Medium: Collaborative Research: Citing Structured and Evolving Data,Citation is an essential part of scientific and scholarly publishing: it is used to gauge the trust placed in published data and for better or worse is an important factor in judging academic reputation. Now that much scientific publishing ‚Äì especially data publishing ‚Äì takes place through a database rather than conventional journals how should something that is found in a database be cited? More generally how should digital data that is stored in a repository with internal structure and which is subject to change be cited? This is the case for the very large number of curated databases through which much scientific publishing now takes place; it is also true of most scientific data collections which are seldom stable. There has recently been substantial interest in the problem of data citation and various organizations have proposed structures for the format and content of citations; however most proposals do not address issues of structure and change that are intrinsic to databases. The focus of this proposal is to develop a framework for data citation which takes into account the following issues: (1) the potentially very large number of possible citations; (2) citations should be both human and machine readable; and (3) citations must conform to specifications prescribed by both the publishers of the data and by the various standards that are being established. All these give rise to interesting computational challenges: citations must be generated automatically from the data; the source data must be guaranteed to support the generation of these citations; and the generated citations must be guaranteed to conform to the specifications. Of course as with any computational problem all this must be done efficiently. Citation is also closely related to provenance and issues of reproducible results. Workflows executable papers and microcitations have all been proposed to support reproducible analysis of data. The work of this project will explore the connections between these ideas and where possible establish a common framework. For many databases the publishers and authors have a clear idea of how they would like their data to be cited and there is enough information in the database to enable these citations to be generated once the right computational machinery has been developed. However interesting questions arise when a set of data to be cited is arrived at by means of a query in which case the query itself may need to be included (an actionable citation). In other cases the navigational structure needed for meaningful citation ‚Äì such as in the case with linked open data or RDF which are ostensibly large amorphous graphs ‚Äì may be missing. The challenge here is to find techniques for discovering or adding that structure to provide the necessary basis for citation.,2013,2016
281p,Robin Matoza,5/11/15,7/31/16,63493,National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,1546139,Collaborative Research: Constraining Volcanic Jet Dynamics with Infrasound Using Numerical and Empirical Models,Explosive volcanic jets produce eruption columns that often form buoyant ash clouds and may fully or partially collapse to form pyroclastic density currents dangerous fast-moving lateral flows of hot ash and gas. These natural hazards directly threaten surrounding communities and global air traffic. Our ability to mitigate these risks is restricted by our inability to safely measure volcanic jets or monitor them co-eruptively. Infrasound (acoustic signals with frequencies below that of human hearing) provides a means to detect the atmospheric oscillations from volcanoes at distances of meters to thousands of kilometers from the source. This project aims to use these signals to constrain the physics of volcanic jets and measure them in real-time. These measurements may be used as input parameters for aviation safety ash-cloud prediction models and toward assessing the hazard presented to local communities by a given eruption. Additionally this work will provide constraints on eruptive parameters and physics for numerical and experimental studies. Recent infrasound recordings of volcanic jets have frequency spectra similar to the acoustic signal produced by man-made jets (jet noise). For the past 60 years aeroacoustics has studied the relationship between the flow properties of man-made jets and the acoustic signal produced. Our long-term objective is to reverse this concept by determining the flow properties of volcanic jets based on the infrasound signal produced by the eruption. This work represents a first step toward this long-term goal. We begin by building a catalog of infrasonic jet noise observations to determine characteristic volcanic jet noise features and determine any correlations between these features and known eruptive parameters. This process includes searching existing infrasound databases using new signal processing tools and empirical and theoretical propagation modeling. We will then use analytical and numerical models of volcanic jets to adapt established empirical models of man-made jet noise to volcanic systems. ,2015,2016

In this region a unique hydrological dataset provides a framework to relate sediment transport changes to land-use in the context of rapid urbanization and climate change. We will use hydrological observations and isotopic measurements to estimate sediment transport over a variety of temporal and spatial scales determine the sources and sinks of the sediment and tie our findings to regional land-use history. We anticipate these efforts will demonstrate that understanding the source and fate of sediment is important as it will allow us to unravel the effect of land-use on sediment transport in sensitive mountain regions undergoing population expansion provide critical information for development and environmental conservation projects and better allow us to use sediment flux measurements on a variety of time scales to estimate geological-time-scale rates of mass export from the landscape. ,2011,2016

To accomplish this we will study erosion patterns in and around deep canyons on the Colorado Plateau in relation to channel steepness patterns and rock properties. Important to our approach is the concept that the spatial structure of short-term erosion rates in disequilibrium landscapes like the Colorado Plateau reflects the longer-term temporal history of mainstem river incision. Not only do the canyons and surrounding landscapes of the Colorado Plateau provide an excellent natural laboratory for this investigation but their study also carries significant broader impact and public education potential because of the iconic status of the Grand Canyon and the recent high profile debate over the antiquity of this dramatic landform (age estimates range from <6 Ma to >60 Ma). Despite the fundamental and long-recognized importance of lithology in landscape evolution it has received little attention in the quantitative studies of landscape evolution in recent decades. Partly this is because we have lacked the ability to quantitatively measure rock strength at the process scale and partly because until recently lacked firm theory to relate rock properties to river incision processes  limitations that can now be overcome. We address three fundamental problems of broad interest to Geologists and Geomorphologists: (1) the role of lithology in river incision and landscape evolution in general (2) how lithologic variability affects and limits our ability to interpret river incision history from study of landforms and (3) the controversial incision history of river canyons in the Colorado Plateau. The back drop to our study is the enigmatic Late Cenozoic exhumation history of the Colorado Plateau but although our results should contribute to solving this long-standing problem it is not our focus. We frame our study around three testable hypotheses concerning the fundamental controls on landscape evolution encoded in canyon landscapes and the last ~1 Myr of river incision history. Given the icon nature of the Grand Canyon and the vast number of tourists that visit the canyon each year public education is essential especially when geoscience educators use National Parks as case studies for teaching exercises. As part of this research we will pursue a geoscience education study (part of the graduate students time commitment) of the effectiveness of using field analogs to teach about geologic process and landscape evolution specifically related to canyon incision and relief generation. Folks living on reservation land on the Colorado Plateau are a key target audience. In addition to our public outreach efforts the proposed study will provide significant training for one graduate student and several undergraduates. All students will interact with the PIs and institutions providing educational experiences for each student that are not typical. Specifically this research will enhance the opportunities for undergraduates for direct involvement in cutting-edge research. We will proactively recruit women and underrepresented minorities. ,2013,2016

The proposed research will develop new understanding of the interplay between hydrology sediment transport/storage and biogeochemistry. The project is designed so that this new knowledge can be generalized and readily transferred to a wide range of fluvial systems beset by sediment-adsorbed contaminants. The study will focus on the longitudinal (downstream) transport and biogeochemical processing of sediment-adsorbed Hg derived from hydraulic gold mining in the Sierra Nevada and mercury mining in the Coast Ranges within and through the Yuba-Feather-Sacramento River system of Northern California USA. It will document the primary sources (Coast Range v. Sierra Nevada) of Hg contamination to lowland ecosystems in the Sacramento Valley and Bay-Delta and the relative contribution and risks of each. It will challenge conventional wisdom by assessing how Hg bioavailability changes along sediment transport pathways irrespective of total Hg concentrations and by identifying/quantifying the controlling processes at the intersection of sedimentation/inundation and biogeochemical modifications of Hg speciation. The proposed work will: 1) mathematically model flood inundation in river corridors to identify areas of high potential of oxidation/reduction; 2) identify preferential zones of sedimentation through numerical modeling of eventbased washload transport and interpret relative sediment deposit age via a detailed and spatially extensive library of sedimentary histories from prior work; 3) identify distinct contamination sources to lowlands by conducting Hg stable isotopic analysis of sediment; and 4) investigate Hg speciation and reactivity in conjunction with changes in Hg species isotopic signatures associated with redox conditions sediment source and ambient chemistry. ,2013,2016

As extension waned towards the end of the Cretaceous (east) or the Paleogene (west), the Ross Embayment lithosphere continued to subside creating the proto Ross Sea. A seismic-stratigraphic and modeling study is proposed to address the transition from basement rock near and above sea level across most of the future Ross Sea region in early Cenozoic time, to sedimentation in shallow water by the end of Oligocene time and into the early Miocene. Paleo-depths and the nature of the sea floor/subaerial surface through time will be quantified, providing models for Oligocene-early Miocene paleo-topography and tests for hypotheses for extension in the Ross Embayment.

In addition to the highly seasonal summer rainfall winter precipitation is important for snowmelt and discharge in the pre-monsoon (spring) season. Runoff from snow is especially significant in the central Asian and western Himalayan regions where hundreds of millions of people reside but observation understanding and prediction of terrestrial water storage and fluxes remain poorly understood. Quantification of seasonal amounts of rain snow glacial and snowmelt waters and associated physical processes are largely unknown despite their importance to pre-monsoon and dry-season water for irrigation drinking and power generation. The main goal of this project is to advance our current understanding of climate processes on regional-to-continental scales and how they affect the water balance in the High Asia Mountains. The project focuses on multiannual-to-decadal variations in the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) and winter western disturbances (WD) and their impacts on rainfall snow and runoff variability in High Asia. The project will focus on three specific objectives:I. Characterize and investigate multi-annual-to-decadal variations in the Indian Summer Monsoon and western disturbances and their regional impacts on the surface water budget in the High Asia Mountains. II. Examine the spatiotemporal variability of the surface water budget including changes in rainfall and snow and their relative roles in driving runoff variations in High Asia. III. Develop case studies to investigate changes in Indian Summer Monsoon and western disturbances seasons and their influences on the long-term variability of snow and associated runoff in the High Asia Mountains. Changes in the Indian Summer Monsoon and western disturbances include extremely wet/dry monsoon seasons high/low frequency and precipitation intensity of winter storms and teleconnections associated with warm/cold El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases. ,2011,2017
287p,Joan Florsheim Edward Keller,9/15/13,2/28/17,22866,National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,EAR-1359734,Collaborative Research: RAPID: Short-and Long-term Sediment Dynamics Following Wildfire in Chaparral Environments,Wildfire disturbs sediment erosion transport and depositional processes in profound ways. Because of the acute reduction in vegetation and organic matter soils burned by fire lose cohesion and infiltration capacity. Along with enhanced soil water repellency runoff and flooding potential are elevated years after fire. Post-fire hydrologic and sedimentologic responses are extremely complex varying with burn severity rainfall regimes geophysical characteristics and vegetation recovery. Although researchers have studied these processes for more than 70 years predicting post-fire effects remains elusive and physically-based models of post-fire runoff and erosion are not yet complete. Part of the difficulty is that temporal windows for observing post-fire effects are comparatively short with direct measurements tending to span only part of the recovery period (typically less than three years). Equally important are longer-term perspectives however in regards to how wildfire impacts Earth surface processes in the context of landscape evolution. Developing predictive understanding of both short- and long-term effects is critical to the future of our planet especially in an era of changing climates that have increased frequencies and magnitudes of wildfires. This proposed RAPID project focuses on production and delivery of dry ravel a characteristic and immediate post-fire response on steep slopes in the western USA. Dry ravel is a dry-season erosion process whereby gravel sediment moving down hillslopes by gravity becomes trapped by vegetation. Burning vegetation releases this sediment enabling its accumulation at margins of ephemeral channels. Dry ravel therefore provides a significant source of sediment into river channels after fire in chaparral environments. The investigators will quantify the volume of dry ravel sediment derived from the recent Springs Fire that burned Big Sycamore Canyon in southern California during May 2013 Using Terrestrial LiDAR scanning (TLS) augmented by field surveys. Additionally the investigators have geomorphic data spanning over 25 years for Big Sycamore Canyon and two comparable basins nearby with different fire histories. Thus comparing the dry ravel processes at these three sites will enable a compelling story of both short- and long-term sediment dynamics following wildfire in chaparral environments. These data are critical toward developing models of the dynamics of dry ravel for further development and testing. ,2013,2017

Here bottom seawater is drawn into basaltic crust and flows vast distances before discharging driven by Earths natural heat loss and associated differences in fluid density and guided by permeable pathways and basement outcrops that link oceanic and crustal realms. The extent of oceanic hydrothermal flow rivals that from rivers to the oceans influencing ocean chemistry crustal properties and a poorly-understood subseafloor biosphere. However little is known about the nature of flow paths and rates of flow through the crust how different crustal regions are connected laterally and vertically and how this flow influences crustal microbial populations. We are completing a series experiments to resolve processes and characteristics of hydrothermal circulation in the ocean crust using long-term borehole observatories (CORKs) as perturbation monitoring and sampling points. Experiments was initiated in 2010 during IODP Expedition 327 following ocean drilling operations to install observatory infrastructure and instrument systems deep below the seafloor. We have combined a series of short-term and long-term pumping and discharge experiments lasing hours to years with a multi-tracer injection experiment to quantify solute dissolved gas and particle flow velocities directions and crustal interactions. Hydrogeologic experiments like these have been performed on land to elucidate conditions in hydrocarbon reservoirs and freshwater aquifers but they have never before been attempted in the ocean crust. Using the same boreholes we are monitoring natural pressure conditions and perturbations the extent of isothermality in the upper crust the chemical evolution of borehole and crustal fluids and the nature and extent of microbial growth in incubators containing chips of rock and minerals. Cross-hole pressure perturbations have been observed and sparse wellhead sampling of fluids from one borehole has recovered tracers injected in a different borehole (hundreds of meters away) demonstrating that the hydrogeologic and tracer experiments are working. But the most complete multi-year records of experimental results remain; these samples were recovered during a 12-day ROV/submersible expedition in August 2014. Shore-based activities are on-going and include hydrogeologic and tracer analyses microbial characterization and integration of physical chemical and microbial data to constrain crustal conditions properties and processes.

290p,Douglas Burbank Bodo Bookhagen,8/1/11,7/31/17,275006,National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,1050070,The Pamir Frontal Thrust System: Rates Style and Controls on Deformation,Our goals include defining how where and at what rates shortening has been accommodated within the Pamir-Tian Shan structural corridor and exploring the extent to which erosion by an axial river modulates shortening rates on faults proximal to the river. We will focus our work along the axis of the structural corridor where we can examine a rich suite of along- strike structural variability in the style orientation and (likely) rate of deformation. The Pamir Frontal Thrust (PFT) is the leading edge of the Pamir orogen. In reality some apparently Pamir-related faults occur to the north of the PFT including nearby faults that ruptured in the 1985 M7.4 Wuqia earthquake [Feng et al. 1988]. Within the study area the PFT tends to be localized within lower Paleogene gypsum beds and it typically carries the entire Cenozoic stratigraphic succession (up to 8 km thick) in its hanging wall. Where the PFT is exposed in the Bozi Tage Range near the Kezilesu River it tends to be a low-angle thrust dipping from 0° to 15°. Ongoing slip on the PFT is evidenced by offset talus slopes that show fresh scarps. Typically the PFT slices across the Xiyu conglomerate an upper Cenozoic time-transgressive fluvial conglomerate that ranges in age from 16 to 0 Ma within the foreland [Heermance et al. 2007] but which is less than 1.6 Ma where it has been paleomagnetically dated a few kilometers north of the PFT in the corridor [Chen et al. 2005]. On the eastern margin of the Mayikake Basin the PFT cuts nearly horizontally across a 50°-dipping 3-km-thick panel of Xiyu conglomerate for about 4 kilometers. ,2011,2017

Few places in the world expose volcanic and marine sedimentary sequences and large uplifted Quaternary terraces that can be used to understand the processes involved in the progressive stages of continental breakup. Because of the rapid tectonic motion in the Gulf of California rift (e.g. Umhoefer 2011) the Santa Rosalia basin is a site where the stratigraphic history and processes of rifting can be studied in detail with exceptional exposures and accessible outcrops. Furthermore the Santa Rosalia basin hosts large Cu-Mn-Co deposits that are not present elsewhere in the Gulf of California rift (Conly 2003; Conly et al. 2005 2006). The tectonic controls on hydrothermal emplacement of these ores are not well known. Many open questions reamin about the rapid tectonic uplift and active faulting the volcanic processes in the arc-rift transition and the style and history of deformation. For over a decade the NSF MARGINS program funded a major effort to understand the process of continental rifting through shipboard and field studies of the Gulf of California. While a great deal of offshore research has focused on the central segment of the Gulf of California particularly in the Guaymas rift field studies on the Baja California Peninsula have largely focused on the northern and southern segments. Relatively little is known about the geology onshore of the Guaymas rift in the Santa Rosalia area because it has not been mapped in over 50 years. We propose to carry out the first modern basin analysis study of the Santa Rosalia area by gathering and integrating stratigraphic volcanological structural and geomorphic data combined with petrographic mineralogical sedimentological geochemical and geochronological laboratory analyses. ,2014,2017

Experiments, both in the field and laboratory, have added mechanistic understanding of biogeochemical processes of Sierran lakes and watersheds. Comparative studies of biological and hydrochemical aspects of lakes, conducted from 1982 to the present, provide a regional context for examination of Sierra-wide conditions and responses to global change. Recent paleo-investigations at Emerald Lake and companion lakes have provided a multi-century context for the 31-year dataset from Emerald Lake. In our LTREB renewal, we propose to complete our decadal research plan to test the hypothesis that altered climate, changing snow regime and changes in atmospheric composition are driving biogeochemical and ecological changes in high elevation ecosystems. We propose to continue long-term study of the Emerald Lake watershed, Tokopah Valley and nearby catchments in order to test conceptual hypotheses regarding drivers of environmental change in high-elevation aquatic ecosystems. The primary foci 140 of the proposed study are: i) continued assessment of the response of lake phytoplankton to changing atmospheric deposition and ii) continued study of the coupling between climate variability and N and P biogeochemistry. These questions will be answered through the continuation of on-going watershed measurements; additional study of lake metabolism; enhanced measurements of atmospheric deposition; and paleolimnological study of lake sediments. Climate conditions have a strong influence on potential N&P source areas, on the incidence of fires, on transport and deposition, and lake ecology. Hence, as a consequence of the considerable interannual variability in California’s Mediterranean climate, it is essential to conduct these studies for at least ten years.",2012,2017

Without direct measurements of the fault during an earthquake the spatio-temporal evolution of the slip on the fault must be inferred from seismic geodetic and geologic observations. While the representation theorem provides the link between the spatio-temporal evolution and the observations the inverse problem has been a quagmire. The number of parameters needed to infer the details of a rupture is much larger than the number of available data i.e. the inverse problem is underdetermined. By itself that is a problem. When coupled with the fact that the temporal variables (rise time and rupture time) are not linearly related to the observations additional complexities arise in the methods for inverting the observations. Nonetheless models of the spatio-temporal evolution of slip i.e. the source process can be found. The quality of these models needs to be quantitatively assessed. High-frequency seismic data exists but has not been fully exploited. These data provide important constraints on stress drops and variations in rupture velocity. By using these data in concert with low-frequency seismograms GPS and InSAR the resulting kinematic models will be better resolved and more robust. Two methods are proposed for exploiting the high-frequency data. First using back projection areas on the fault that produce high-frequency radiation are identified. Using a multiscale inversion the parameters are resolved on a finer scale and used as constraints on the inversion at a larger scale. Second derivatives of the acceleration envelope function are inverted to determine regions of high-frequency radiation. These regions will also be subject to multi-scale inversion to constrain the overall inversions. In combination the two methods will improve the resolution and robustness of the inverted rupture model. ,2012,2017
298p,Brad Hacker,9/1/14,8/31/17,173765,National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,EAR-1419751,Collaborative Research: Did the Pamir gneiss domes and salient form by northward underthrusting of India or southward subduction and rollback of Asia?,The Pamir orogen is distinguished by a pronounced northward-convex salient and a spatially extensive orogen-parallel suite of gneiss domes. Both the salient and gneiss-dome suite are thought to have developed synchronously and largely since Miocene time. At depth the thick crust (≥ 65 km) of the Pamir is underlain by a cold mantle lid interpreted to be northward underthrust Indian lithosphere; it is bound in the north by a southward-dipping zone of intermediate-depth seismicity that has been attributed to intracontinental subduction of Asian lithosphere. We propose to test two end-member ‘tectonic drivers that may genetically link all of these features: (1) a lower-plate-driven relatively rapid and short-lived phase of northward rollback/retreat of a southward-subducting slab of Asian lithosphere during which the Pamir gneiss domes accommodated significant net horizontal extension (~150 km) and growth of the Pamir salient; versus (2) an upper-plate-driven protracted northward underthrusting/indentation of Indian lithosphere which forced vertical exhumation of Asian mid-crust above it and southward subduction of Asian lithosphere beneath it. These two end-member scenarios are not mutually exclusive in that they may have acted in concert or played varying roles in space and time. Nevertheless they make contrasting predictions at the scale of the entire orogen that can be assessed with geologic investigations. We focus this project on testing end-member model predictions for the kinematic metamorphic and magmatic evolution of the gneiss domes. Our approach will integrate (i) metamorphic petrology and monazite U/Th-Pb geochronology and heavy REE analysis to quantify the history of prograde and retrograde metamorphism (ii) geologic mapping and structural analysis to constrain the kinematics of gneiss dome exhumation; (iii) moderate- and low-temperature thermochronology to quantify the history of exhumation; and (iv) U-Pb geochronology and isotope analysis of zircon (Hf) and titanite (Nd) to quantify the history and sources of Cenozoic magmatism. ,2014,2017

Microenvironments have played critical roles in rapid vegetation response to past climate change such as the emergence from the last glacial maximum. This project tests the importance of these difficult-to-model features in vegetation response to future climate change. The overarching research question addressed is """"How does macroecological response to climate change emerge from finer scale climate and population processes?"" The project uses a combination of modeling and field experimentation to answer this question. A collaborative research team will model microenvironment impacts on species distribution abundance and diversity under rapid climate change for four tree species across four study sites in the Sierra Nevada and Coast Ranges of California. This proposed research design is a novel combination of site trials distribution models and population models incorporating measured (rather than inferred) species' tolerances relevant to microenvironments at scales that vary over five orders of magnitude (30m-3000km). Analytical tools will include reciprocal transplant experiments field surveys species trait-based distribution models population models and biogeographic models of climate change. Physical models of microenvironments are linked to models of tree species occupation of microenvironments which in turn inform models of population-level responses. Climate change is simulated using Regional Earth Systems Models and statistical downscaling from global climate model simulations. Field experiments examine the response of establishment phase (seedling) dynamics the life history stage most sensitive to altered climate through transplanting protocols to lower (warmer) elevations. The frequency of fire in the landscape is projected using correlations of fire to landscape conditions under current climate. Establishment phase and fire information is then used in models of single species population responses and multi-taxa responses in complex landscapes. These population-level models will give clear indication of whether microenvironments change species dynamics in rapid climate change in ways that will dramatically change range-wide and continental-scale biological responses to climate change.",2011,2017

As extension waned towards the end of the Cretaceous (east) or the Paleogene (west) the Ross Embayment lithosphere continued to subside creating the proto Ross Sea. A seismic-stratigraphic and modeling study is proposed to address the transition from basement rock near and above sea level across most of the future Ross Sea region in early Cenozoic time to sedimentation in shallow water by the end of Oligocene time and into the early Miocene. Paleo-depths and the nature of the sea floor/subaerial surface through time will be quantified providing models for Oligocene-early Miocene paleo-topography and tests for hypotheses for extension in the Ross Embayment. This work affects modeling of West Antarctic ice volumes including large early Miocene volume fluctuations. ,2014,2017

The North Anatolian Fault (NAF) a young continental transform has been proposed as a prime example of this process. In the Marmara Sea however the NAF splits into several branches and forms a transtensional basin. Most of the strain is associated with the Northern Branch which spawned three 1200-m deep basins. It has been proposed that the strain is focusing on the Northern Branch and that the Central and Southern branches are being abandoned. However recent multichannel sparker and chirp seismic reflection and multibeam bathymetry data demonstrate continued activity of the Central Branch. These new data collected in 2013 and 2014 image the stratigraphy and numerous individual fault strands on the southern shelf of the Marmara Sea. We will use these data in combination with a large suite of available previous data to map the stratigraphy and faulting related to the Central Branch of the NAF. We propose to extend our published stratigraphic age model covering the past 0.5 Ma to greater depth and age. Earliest Pliocene fill of Messinian (~5 Ma) erosional valleys dated on land will be projected short distances to our near-shore reflection data to provide a base to the age model. Based on this stratigraphic framework we will evaluate fault kinematics of many strands over the southern Marmara Sea during the last several million years. We will test the age model using sequence stratigraphic modeling. Basin modeling will be used to separate the effects of sediment loading compaction and tectonic subsidence and test the extension estimates. ,2015,2018

310p,Joshua Schimel,7/1/14,6/30/19,704320,National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,PLR-1417758,Does E. vaginatum take up organic N?,"Twenty years ago Chapin et al. (1993) showed that Eriophorum vaginatum the plant species that dominates arctic tussock tundra not only can use organic N-sources but actually grows better with amino acids as a sole N-source than with inorganic N salts. This catalyzed a cascade of research that transformed our vision of the plant-soil N-cycle; small N-containing organic compounds have replaced NH4+ as the centerpoint of the N cycle. A challenge of this shifting view however is that no one has actually quantified for any plant species growing in the wild let alone for E. vaginatum-- how much of its total N demand is met by organic N-sources! The challenge to answering this question has been methodological; standard 15N isotope tracer methods show that many plants can take up amino acids but without accounting for dilution of the 15N tracer into the native N pools as they rapidly turn over they can not assess how much of the native compounds are taken up by plants. This project would overcome this problem and answer the question ""Do plants really use organic N?"" The project would use a combination of methods integrated through simulation modeling. The key novel method is microdialysis in which a probe the size of a root is inserted into the soil a carrier solution flows through it and small molecules diffuse into it. If water is used as the carrier it creates a diffusion gradient while if a dextran solution is used it draws water into the probe and so creates mass flow. Thus this can indicate which substrates in soil are moving to the root surface. Microdialysis will be coupled with intact root uptake kinetic studies isotope partitioning and analyzing diffusion and transport of amino acids NH4+ and NO3- through soil to parameterize a root uptake model that will be used to synthesize and integrate the results. This will allow evaluate the actual N sources used by E. vaginatum. The first phase of the work will be done under controlled conditions in the greenhouse; then having refined the methods and assessed model parameters we will move into the field to assess seasonal patterns of N uptake and how it is affected by environmental manipulations.

Lavas erupted at the Baffin Island flood basalt province which record the initiation of Icelandic hotspot volcanism at 62 Ma host the highest know terrestrial mantle-derived 3He/4He (50 Ra ratio to atmosphere). Mid-Miocene Icelandic lavas record the second highest 3He/4He globally (43 Ra). Unlike the Baffin Island lavas the mid-Miocene Icelandic lavas were not emplaced through continental crust. Thus the Icelandic lavas provide the best opportunity to evaluate the radiogenic isotopic composition of the highest 3He/4He mantle domain free of continental assimilation. A recent discovery identified large magnitude 182W anomalies in Baffin Island lavas with high 3He/4He (≥ 43 Ra). In the 182Hf-182W system 182Hf decays to 182W (t1/2 = 8.9 Ma) thus all 182W/184W heterogeneity was generated during the lifetime of 182Hf (<50 Ma after accretion). Therefore the discovery of 182W anomalies shows that early-Hadean signatures have survived for >4.5 Ga in the dynamic mantle. The preservation of Hadean 182W anomalies in the modern high 3He/4He mantle is an exciting discovery and provides a key constraint for geodynamic models seeking to describe the time-scales over which geochemical heterogeneities are preserved in the mantle. The discovery of Hadean-generated 182W anomalies in lavas sampling the modern (62 Ma) mantle leads to several key questions regarding the 3He/4He mantle sampled by the Icelandic hotspot: 1. Are positive 182W anomalies associated with high 3He/4He ratios in mantle-derived lavas at other localities? 2. Does a moderately high 3He/4He lava from Icelands neovolcanic zone which hosts a Hadean 129Xe/130Xe signature also preserve a Hadean 182W anomaly? 3. Do 182W anomalies exhibit relationships with He Sr Nd Pb and Os isotopes? Such relationships will provide insights into the geodynamic processes that preserve 182W anomalies in the mantle. ,2016,2019
312p,James Frew,8/1/13,7/31/19,250364,National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,1302236,III: Medium: Collaborative Research: Citing Structured and Evolving Data,Citation is an essential part of scientific and scholarly publishing: it is used to gauge the trust placed in published data and for better or worse is an important factor in judging academic reputation. Now that much scientific publishing  especially data publishing  takes place through a database rather than conventional journals how should something that is found in a database be cited? More generally how should digital data that is stored in a repository with internal structure and which is subject to change be cited? This is the case for the very large number of curated databases through which much scientific publishing now takes place; it is also true of most scientific data collections which are seldom stable. There has recently been substantial interest in the problem of data citation and various organizations have proposed structures for the format and content of citations; however most proposals do not address issues of structure and change that are intrinsic to databases. The focus of this proposal is to develop a framework for data citation which takes into account the following issues: (1) the potentially very large number of possible citations; (2) citations should be both human and machine readable; and (3) citations must conform to specifications prescribed by both the publishers of the data and by the various standards that are being established. All these give rise to interesting computational challenges: citations must be generated automatically from the data; the source data must be guaranteed to support the generation of these citations; and the generated citations must be guaranteed to conform to the specifications. Of course as with any computational problem all this must be done efficiently. Citation is also closely related to provenance and issues of reproducible results. Workflows executable papers and microcitations have all been proposed to support reproducible analysis of data. The work of this project will explore the connections between these ideas and where possible establish a common framework. For many databases the publishers and authors have a clear idea of how they would like their data to be cited and there is enough information in the database to enable these citations to be generated once the right computational machinery has been developed. However interesting questions arise when a set of data to be cited is arrived at by means of a query in which case the query itself may need to be included (an actionable citation). In other cases the navigational structure needed for meaningful citation  such as in the case with linked open data or RDF which are ostensibly large amorphous graphs  may be missing. The challenge here is to find techniques for discovering or adding that structure to provide the necessary basis for citation. ,2013,2019

MCS defines thermal mass and compositional (major/trace element and isotope) characteristics of melt ± minerals ± fluid phase in a magmatic system undergoing recharge (magma mixing) assimilation and crystallization. The goals of our proposed work are to (1) Finalize MCS for general release to the petrologic community by early 2017 based upon feedback obtained from beta users in the last year. Streamlined input and output automated trace element and isotope calculations web-based tutorials workshops and YouTube videos will allow a spectrum of scholars to use MCS in their own studies. (2) Building on successful development of the exploratory (i.e. toy) binary eutectic model develop three new toy models that sequentially incorporate known thermodynamic features of natural systems (peritectic solid solution ternary). These will provide insight into the thermodynamics of magma mixing. (3) Apply MCS to volcanic (Karymsky Llaima) and plutonic (Kiglapait and Bushveld intrusions) suites that show indisputable evidence of magma mixing. (4) Extend MCS capabilities to include reaction of cumulates with magma melt eruption and the rhyolite MELTS H2O-CO2 solubility model. These new versions of MCS will be released. (5) Develop a magma mixing taxonomy by using toy and MCS results and observations from natural systems to identify and group dominant characteristics of mixed magma products and evaluate if these are associated with diagnostic initial conditions. ,2016,2019

Experiments both in the field and laboratory have added mechanistic understanding of biogeochemical processes of Sierran lakes and watersheds. Comparative studies of biological and hydrochemical aspects of lakes conducted from 1982 to the present provide a regional context for examination of Sierra-wide conditions and responses to global change. Recent paleo-investigations at Emerald Lake and companion lakes have provided a multi-century context for the 31-year dataset from Emerald Lake. In our LTREB renewal we propose to complete our decadal research plan to test the hypothesis that altered climate changing snow regime and changes in atmospheric composition are driving biogeochemical and ecological changes in high elevation ecosystems. We propose to continue long-term study of the Emerald Lake watershed Tokopah Valley and nearby catchments in order to test conceptual hypotheses regarding drivers of environmental change in high-elevation aquatic ecosystems. The primary foci of the proposed study are: i) continued assessment of the response of lake phytoplankton to changing atmospheric deposition and ii) continued study of the coupling between climate variability and N and P biogeochemistry. These questions will be answered through the continuation of on-going watershed measurements; additional study of lake metabolism; enhanced measurements of atmospheric deposition; and paleolimnological study of lake sediments. Climate conditions have a strong influence on potential N&P source areas on the incidence of fires on transport and deposition and lake ecology. Hence as a consequence of the considerable interannual variability in Californias Mediterranean climate it is essential to conduct these studies for at least ten years. ,2012,2019

Biostratigraphic correlation has been hampered by the provinciality of many early animal groups including trilobites and the inevitable diachroneity of fossil first appearance datums (FADs). Likewise deriving correlations based only on qualitative ‘wiggle matching of chemostratigrapic records such as carbon (?13C) or strontium (87Sr/86Sr) isotopes usually is ambiguous and can be distorted by disconformities and carbonate diagenesis. Furthermore without U-Pb zircon ages from interbedded tuffs and volcaniclastic rocks even stratigraphy that is well correlated in relative time will not constrain the rate and duration of important biological and geochemical changes. The PIs will construct a comprehensive database of animal fossil occurrences litho- and chemostratigraphy and U-Pb zircon geochronology of interbedded volcaniclastics. Multiproxy records of variable diversity and completeness from around the globe will be correlated using the CONOP seriation software. The resulting composite stratigraphy will place each local record in relative and absolute time based not on one variable like FADs or ?13C but rather on all available stratigraphic observations simultaneously. In addition we will improve on the CONOP algorithms by adapting statistical techniques that compute uncertainties in stratigraphic correlation by taking into account variables such as curve-matching ambiguity and facies control on fossil preservation. The result will be a first-of-its-kind timeline of early Cambrian animal evolution and ocean geochemical change with quantitative uncertainties. We will use this timeline to constrain a new Earth-system model that tracks C O S Mg Ca ALK P Sr U and Mo in sea water and sediment pore-fluid. ,2014,2019

Four young PIs leading this project (Jackson Cottle Rioux and Weldeab) were trained on modern TIMS instruments and actively utilize TIMS-based measurements in their current NSF-funded research; the students and post-docs of PI Hacker also make extensive use of TIMS in their research.

The arrival of the new instrument will coincide with the completion of a state-of-the-art metal-free clean lab built as part of PI Jacksons start-up. The new TIMS facility at UCSB will: 1) enable new fields of discovery by opening up new analytical avenues for research (e.g. ultra-precise 142Nd/144Nd precise analyses of sub-nanogram quantities of Sr and Nd isotopes and high-precision U/Pb ages on (sub-) single zircons); 2) transform UCSBs analytical capabilities permitting development of cutting edge new analytical techniques that combine high precision TIMS with in situ isotopic and elemental analyses using the laser ablation multi-collector (LA-MC)-ICP-MS and electron-probe microanalyzer (EPMA); and 3) carry the excitement for research and discovery in analytical geoscience to the next generation of researchers and teachers.

The US east coast is an archetypical example of a passive continental margin the remnant of a once-dynamic rifting system that enabled the breakup of the Pangean supercontinent and the earliest formation of the northern Atlantic Ocean at incipient seafloor spreading centers. This margin holds clues to the processes of continental breakup encoded in the transitional region between continent and young ocean. New broadband seismological data from a 2014-2015 amphibious seismic deployment holds promise for a more detailed analysis of the ENAM region particularly offshore where little work has thus far been carried out using the newly available data set. Preliminary research in this region revealed unexplained patterns of seismic anisotropy (a directional dependence to seismic velocity often linked to ancient flow and/or architecture of magmatic plumbing systems) and unclear linkages between crustal thickness magnetic anomalies and deeper structure of the tectonic plates. We propose an integrated analysis of the anisotropic seismic properties of this margin using a combination of different seismic data types. We propose using new codes developed by PI Eilon to conduct a joint inversion of surface and body waves for lithospheric velocity structure. This approach provides constraints on discontinuities and absolute velocity including unprecedented lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary constraints. ,2018,2019
319p,Brad Hacker John Cottle,2/15/16,1/31/20,332772,National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,1551054,Collaborative Research: Characterizing and Modeling Crustal Recycling,Recycling of continental crust into the mantle is among the most-important processes driving the chemical and physical evolution of Earth. Mechanisms of crustal recycling include arc subduction sediment subduction continent subduction subduction erosion and foundering. These processes dictate the rates and types of crustal chemical and physical evolution—and even more-fundamental issues such as the secular evolution of continental volume—but are only loosely understood. This limitation has led to a wide range of viewpoints on the efficiency of the recycling process. If for example 95% of continental crustal material that is ablated by subduction erosion is returned to the mantle [Scholl and von Huene 2007] this process reduces the global continental volume at a rate of ~1.3 km3 /yr and the eroded material comes from all crustal levels. Alternatively if crustal material removed by subduction erosion undergoes buoyancy-driven fractionation the mafic material may return to the mantle but the felsic material may be relaminated to the base of the crust [Hacker et al.  2011; 2015]. Our understanding of crustal recycling comes chiefly from i) geodynamic models ii) large-scale box models that use specific isotopic systems to quantify recycling rates [Coltice et al.  2000; Simon and Lecuyer 2005]; iii) exposed arc rocks [Kelemen et al.  2003; Ducea et al.  2013] from which one can infer the magnitude and timescale of lower crustal foundering; iv) geophysical images of foundering material [Zandt & Carrigan 1993]; and v) xenoliths which provide snapshots of processes at depth. Among these techniques xenoliths provide our only actual samples of the physical and chemical materials and processes involved in crustal recycling and constitute our only way to verify or ground truth inferences made from geodynamic models box models exposed arcs and geophysical images. For example xenoliths provided the spectacular record of foundering of the Sierra Nevada arc lower crust and upper mantle [Ducea & Saleeby 1996; Chin et al.  2013] and the foundation for interpreting seismic velocities as images of the recycling process [Zandt & Carrigan 1993]. In spite of the tremendous insight that xenoliths afford our understanding of crustal recycling basically all xenoliths from mantle depths are mafic or ultramafic—with two exceptions: one locality in the Pamir and one in Tibet. These unusual xenolith localities thus present a special opportunity to understand the chemical and physical processes that attend crustal recycling. We propose to integrate geochemical constraints from the Pamir xenoliths with geodynamic models to address the following questions: What is the timescale of recycling: how rapidly did the crust sink metamorphose and melt? How do typical continental crustal rocks reach mantle depths? What mineralogical changes occur during recycling? How do density and buoyancy evolve during recycling? Under what circumstances can part of a typical crustal section founder? To what extent does sorting occur during recycling? For example can mafic or ultramafic rocks pull felsic rocks down into the mantle? Or do the felsic rocks always manage to escape on the way down? Is crust in the process of being recycled differentiable from the surrounding mantle using seismic wavespeeds?,2016,2020

We will focus our initial efforts on a large and well-characterized suite of granulite-facies xenoliths from northern Tanzania followed by similar studies of well-characterized lower crustal xenoliths from the Siberian Craton (Udachnaya kimberlite) and the Superior Craton (Attawapiskat kimberlites). The methods developed here can be applied to other suitable xenolith suites in order to develop global constraints on the proportion of heat producing elements that reside in the continental crust. ,2017,2020

The first project investigates the causes of the systematic depletion in Mo (relative to Ce and Pr  which have similar bulk partition coefficients) that the student discovered in many granitic suites through study of the Mo inventory in common crustal rocks. This depletion may be caused by i) loss of Mo to a magmatic vapor phase (MVP) during late-stage differentiation ii) loss of Mo during crystal fractionation in the crust due to its partitioning into Ti-bearing phases and/or iii) loss of Mo to a Ti-bearing phase (e.g. rutile) in subducted oceanic crust. To evaluate these possibilities we will i) determine the Mo abundances and partitioning in xenolithic eclogites from the Man Shield Sierra Leone that have been interpreted to be residues of Archean oceanic crust trapped within the cratonic mantle and ii) analyze a calc-alkaline differentiation suite to determine whether Mo is lost to Fe-Ti oxides. The second project seeks to understand the systematic change in Mo isotopic composition of the upper continental crust that the student discovered through analyses of glacial diamictite composites. We hypothesize that the trend to lower S98Mo seen in diamictites deposited from the Archean to the Paleozoic results from retention of isotopically light Mo within Fe and Mn hydroxides developed in the regolith following the GOE. To test this hypothesis we plan to analyze Mo isotopes in two well-characterized weathering profiles developed on basalt and a diabase for which mineralogy major and trace elements and Li and Mg isotopes have previously been determined. If our hypothesis stands we expect the basalt profile to exhibit a lighter Mo isotope signature as it contains abundant Fe-Mn oxides and hydroxides relative to the diabase profile. These data in combination with the Mo isotope data for the glacial diamictites may allow us to track the onset of oxidative weathering of the continents. The final project evaluates the degree to which variably chalcophile elements like Mo partition into sulfides in the mantle through a study of well characterized massif peridotites. In addition to determining chalcophile element partitioning behavior we seek to provide additional constraints on the abundances of these elements (many of which are moderately to highly volatile e.g. As Cd Ga In Sn Tl) in the primitive mantle. For this work we will analyze a wide array of chalcophile elements in both whole rocks and minerals of well-characterized peridotites from the Pyrenees. By determining the behavior of these elements during mantle melting we will provide additional constraints on their abundances in the primitive mantle and from this their partitioning into the core. ,2018,2020

To enable California to optimize future water infrastructure legislation and economy scientists at 5 UC campuses LLNL and LBL will address measurement and modeling of water from headwaters in the Sierra Nevada through rivers and reservoirs to and through groundwater in Californias Central Valley. The goal is to provide scientific information to optimize water storage quality and groundwater sustainability as precipitation varies temperatures warm and population grows. To consider the range of headwater-to-groundwater systems we focus on three river basins comprising different climatic geologic and socio-economic settings -- Shasta R (volcanic northernmost lowest and wettest) Kings R (granitic southernmost driest highest poorest) and the American R (metamorphic wealthiest). Novel methods to monitor and model ongoing and future changes in rain and snowmelt in the headwaters will be coupled with process-driven modeling and measurement of evapotranspiration groundwater recharge and withdrawal in the lowlands. Models will consider changes in water policy and infrastructure and resulting impacts on energy production and consumption. Collaboration between the campuses and Labs will build interdisciplinary teams that include faculty in all career stages who study aspects of the water cycle from remote sensing of precipitation to water policy. Collaborators from LLNL and LBL contribute capabilities and expertise in isotopic tracing of water high-performance computer modeling of groundwater and surface water and energy implications of water management. This proposal strengthens DOEs mission to ensure America's security and prosperity by addressing energy environmental and nuclear challenges through science and technology. Ultimately the alliance between UC faculty postdoctoral fellows and students with scientists at LLNL and LBL will improve understanding of how changing climate and water demand will affect water resources through the middle to the end of this century. Our proposal will nurture a new generation of scientists in the nexus of climate water and energy. An advisory board of water practitioners will help target our findings to help water managers make the best decisions for Californias precious water resources. ,2018,2020

An international team of scientists from Brazil Colombia the U.S. France Germany Norway and the United Kingdom will develop scenarios of biodiversity and ecosystem services for the extensive floodplains of the lowland Amazon basin which support one of Earth's great reservoirs of biodiversity. The focus is on floodplains of ""whitewater"" rivers which include the mainstem Amazon floodplain and tributaries such as the Juruá. Seasonally inundated by nutrient-rich sediments these floodplains have historically been centers for human settlements practicing subsistence agriculture supplemented by fishing and hunting; whitewater floodplain districts are thus the most densely populated rural areas in central Amazonia. To explore scenarios of Amazonian floodplain biodiversity and services in a rapidly changing socioenvironment the project will: 1) Map spatio-temporal variability of floodplain habitats providing a basis for scaling up existing biodiversity data sets and for evaluating the potential impacts of regional drivers such as climate land use intensification and dams upon wetland habitats. 2) Characterize interactions between local populations and their environment and how they may adapt to changes in regional drivers including socio-demographic and socio-economic drivers. 3) Analyze how public policies and governance have contributed to wetland habitat protection and freshwater biodiversity conservation.

This in turn suggests that seismic data may be used for monitoring the hurricane intensity if its seismic-wave excitation mechanism could be understood. The Earthscope network unexpectedly recorded hurricane data in the last five years and exactly provide such information for understanding the atmosphere-land interaction. Our investigation on Hurricane Isaac (2012) has demonstrated that the Earthscope data do provide new important information on the seismic-wave excitation process. The primary goal of this project is to apply our current approach to other hurricanes from the Earthscope data and test the stochastic seismic-wave excitation theory that has been developed. This knowledge will then be applied to monitoring the intensity changes of hurricanes while they are still in the oceans. If such a monitoring becomes possible it may become a useful tool for hurricane-hazard mitigation. ,2016,2020

Both technical and conceptual limits have prevented the collection and analysis of rich empirical datasets with high temporal frequency over large spatial extents necessary to investigate how changes to seasonal precipitation patterns are affecting food security. This research project will transform both methodological and conceptual frameworks for assessing the sustainability of dryland agricultural systems. The research will bring new understanding of how dryland farmers adapt to within-season variability in climate and how those adaptations affect their current and future resilience to climate variability and climate change. Project findings will improve forecast models used to monitor and predict the sustainability of water-dependent agricultural systems. By marrying the simple idea of cell phone adoption with state-of-art research in data science crop prediction and environmental/social monitoring the project will advance and accelerate scientific understanding of an important global sustainability problem.,2017,2020

Long-period (LP 0.5-5 Hz) seismicity a particular type of volcanic seismicity is used routinely by volcano monitoring scientists to forecast and assess eruptions and mitigate hazards but its source origin remains controversial. This project will perform detailed investigations into the origin of an intriguing and largely overlooked additional type of volcanic seismicity: numerous tiny-amplitude LPs (LP subevents) that accompany the regular LPs. Tiny LP subevents have apparently been recorded at multiple volcanoes worldwide but their origin remains mysterious. Millions of tiny LP subevents were exceptionally well recorded by a dense seismic network during the 2004-2008 eruption of Mount St. Helens (MSH) but were not cataloged or analyzed. These LP subevents contain rich unexploited information that has the potential to better elucidate the processes generating volcanic seismicity. This project will utilize novel computationally intensive processing methods adapted from studying regional seismicity in Southern California and Hawaii. This research will map the spatiotemporal distribution and source mechanisms of millions of tiny LP subevents to high precision and determine their relation to other volcanic seismicity and eruptive activity. The primary dataset is from MSH but additional datasets from Mammoth Mountain CA Kilauea Volcano HI and other volcanoes will be exploited for comparative analyses and hypothesis testing across multiple volcanic systems. ,2017,2020

As preserved remnants of the underthrust plate sole exposures can be used to better understand the formation and obduction of ophiolites. In two previous projects PI Matt Rioux and his collaborators have used high-precision isotope dilution-thermal ionization mass spectrometry (ID-TIMS) U-Pb zircon dating to study the timing of ophiolite formation and the development of subduction below the ophiolite. New data from two large exposures of the metamorphic sole yielded surprising results indicating that that the earliest sole metamorphism was synchronous with or pre-dated formation of the ophiolite crust and that metamorphism was diachronous along the length of the ophiolite spanning ≥1.3 Ma contrary to current models. To better understand the implications of these results to the origin of ophiolites Rioux proposes to carry out high-precision dating at exposures of the metamorphic sole throughout the Semail ophiolite. ,2017,2020

On average 2 volcanoes are in a state of eruption every year. Volcanoes in the Aleutian Islands Alaska Peninsula and Cook Inlet are capable of sudden explosive ash-cloud forming eruptions which are potentially hazardous to passenger and freight aircraft along this heavily travelled air corridor. Many of Alaskas volcanoes are in remote locations with harsh environments. Monitoring these volcanoes represents a formidable challenge and many of the volcanoes are not instrumented. Infrasound (acoustic waves with frequencies below the 20 Hz hearing threshold of the human ear) is a rapidly developing technology to understand and monitor explosive volcanic eruptions. Modest-sized explosive eruptions produce powerful infrasound signals that propagate efficiently over thousands of kilometers in the atmosphere. However to date these signals have been recorded by sparse infrasound sensor networks limiting our understanding of their source generation and propagation through the atmosphere. The EarthScope Transportable Array (TA) is currently being deployed in Alaska bringing the densest ever combined seismic and infrasonic network to one of the worlds most active volcanic regions. Exploiting this novel dataset this project will advance the capability of acoustic early warning systems of volcanic eruptions for aviation safety and will assess the potential contribution of large sensor networks such as the TA to volcano monitoring. At the end of the project an operational volcano-acoustic monitoring system resulting from this work will be implemented at the Alaska Volcano Observatory. This work will capitalize on the unprecedented seismo-acoustic dataset starting to become available as the TA records Alaskas routine explosive volcanism with dense spatial wavefield sampling. Volcano seismo-acoustics is a rapidly advancing research field where basic questions remain on the source mechanisms source directionality atmospheric propagation and seismo-acoustic coupling from explosive volcanic eruptions. This project will focus on detection discrimination and location of the signals using novel methods; quantifying the seismo-acoustic wavefield; investigating the source mechanisms; quantifying seismo-acoustic wave coupling; and understanding infrasound propagation in the spatio-temporally varying atmosphere. Through a combination of data analysis and modeling we will characterize and quantify diverse seismic and infrasonic signals recorded at a range of distances and directions from the explosive eruption source. We will address the following questions: (1) How do observed acoustic and seismic signals from explosive volcanic eruptions vary with distance and azimuth to the source? (2) How does acoustic propagation differ for various types of explosive eruptions? (3) What kind of volcanic source information can be determined from long-range seismo-acoustic data? (4) What are the wavefield sampling limitations in previous volcano infrasound studies? (5) What other infrasound sources are present in Alaska? Our team will work with the EarthScope National Office at the University of Alaska Fairbanks to help highlight this research and its impacts. Multi-media products illustrating seismo-acoustic wavefields from volcanic eruptions in Alaska will be distributed via the web for use in public information packets and education and outreach. Event catalogs and related data products will be publically available with notable infrasound events uploaded to the IRIS TA Infrasound Reference Event Database (TAIRED). ,2016,2020

However the major fluxes in the marine Fe cycle remain poorly quantified: ocean models that attempt to synthesize our understanding of Fe biogeochemistry predict widely different Fe inputs to the ocean and are often unable to capture first-order features of the Fe distribution. The proposed work aims to resolve these problems using advanced data assimilation (inverse) methods to ""teach"" the widely used Biogeochemical Elemental Cycling (BEC) model how to better represent Fe sources sinks and cycling processes. This will be achieved by implementing BEC in the efficient Ocean Circulation Inverse Model (OCIM) and expanding it to simulate the cycling of additional tracers that constrain unique aspects of the Fe cycle including aluminum thorium helium and Fe isotopes. In this framework our inverse model can rapidly explore alternative representations of Fe-cycling processes guided by new high-quality observations. Through this model-data synthesis we will address three specific objectives: (i) To quantify the magnitude of each Fe source to the ocean; (ii) To better understand the loss of Fe by particle scavenging and quantify the lifetime of Fe in the ocean; (iii) To make new robust predictions of Fe cycling under future climate change scenarios by coupling the improved BEC to an Earth System Model.

In particular observational estimates of 20th century trends in the Walker circulation provide conflicting results with some suggesting a strengthening and others a weakening or no trend complicating the attribution of these trends to any specific forcing. Paleoclimate records can improve the detection and attribution of trends by providing longer-term context but their use has been hindered by the lack of multi-proxy synthesis products and climate model simulations covering the last millennium. We propose to create new quantitative reconstructions of multiple Walker circulation metrics using the recently constructed PAGES Iso2k database and to evaluate the mechanisms for variability and trends in these metrics using the Community Earth System Model Last Millennium Ensemble (LME) and new simulations with its isotope-enabled complement (iLME).

Hawaii Island is one of the most tectonically volcanically and seismically active regions on Earth. The USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO) operates a seismic network that has recorded over 260000 earthquakes since 1986 but this rich dataset has not been fully exploited. This project supports collaboration between HVO and U.C. San Diego to apply a number of new large-dataset processing methods to learn more about seismic activity on Hawaii and its relationship to faults and volcanoes. It also supports the educational program at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and U.C. San Diego by providing funds for graduate student support. The results from this study are expected to yield a sharper and more comprehensive view of fault zone characteristics as well as generate public databases of high-resolution information on seismicity characteristics suitable for other researchers in their studies of Hawaiian geology tectonics and volcanism. This research will lead to improved descriptions of seismicity and tectonics for Hawaii which will improve our ability to monitor and characterize volcanic and earthquake hazards. By performing systematic and comprehensive analyses of seismicity recorded by HVO this work will improve earthquake location precision provide robust estimates of the patterns of earthquake stress drops and compute more reliable earthquake focal mechanisms on Hawaii. Integrating these results will better characterize crustal and mantle fault zones and magma conduits in and around Kilauea and Mauna Loa volcanoes and will help to resolve the relationships between seismicity volcanic activity and strain transients. Our results will address the following questions: (1) Relocated microearthquakes in Hawaii align along resolvable fault and conduit structures—what do these structures reveal about tectonic and volcanic processes? (2) What is the origin of recently discovered seismicity rings in Hawaii? (3) How do the stress drops of Hawaiian earthquakes compare to other regions? Are there variations in earthquake stress drops that can be used to characterize stress field heterogeneity and identify regions of stress concentration? (4) Can focal mechanisms be improved for small earthquakes in Hawaii and what do they reveal about the faulting process and stress state? (5) Can repeating earthquakes with nearly identical waveforms be used to resolve temporal variations in seismic velocity associated with tectonic and volcanic activity?

Such conditions have affected the evolution of 15 major wildfires in SB (since 1955) responsible for loss of life injuries millions of dollars in property loss and significant environmental impacts. The coastal communities of SB with nearly 200000 people are particularly exposed to wildfire hazards as most of the population lives in a narrow zone between the mountains and the ocean. US-101 highway runs parallel to the coast and is the area most important evacuation route. SB Fire Department along with other agencies rely extensively on the National Weather Service (NWS) to provide accurate forecasts of wind direction and speed onset and demise of windstorms in preparing for firefighting strategies. However the current approaches are limited in scope detail and how interacting mechanisms are taken into account. To enhance capabilities and understanding an interdisciplinary team of experts in atmospheric sciences fire-weather ecosystem management remote sensing and transportation modeling propose to develop a framework that better accounts for mechanisms of downslope windstorms and fire spread regimes in order to derive probability risks of extreme hazards along this coastal region.

The origin of the isotopic diversity in melt inclusions remains a source of debate: Is it the result of mixing pristine magmas from different mantle sources or the result of crustal assimilation?

C. Mack & D'Antonio 1998). Invasive species are estimated to cost $120 billion annually in management and mitigation costs in the US (Pimentel et al. 2000; Pimentel Zuniga and Morrison 2005) making this a salient issue for land and wildlife managers. Despite this little is known about how to frame the management of invasive species in a way that facilitates public support. Prospect theory would suggest that the public will respond more strongly to frames that communicate possible losses from invasive species. Further invasive species impacts are an example of an environmental problem that has not become politicized thereby providing a useful test of prospect theory in the environmental arena where costs are often concentrated and benefits diffuse (Leung et al. 2002; Finnoff et al. 2007). Invasive species cover a range of species and human perception of them may interact with how the public perceives the potential gains or losses from the presence of the species. Prospect theory can provide important insights to how the public perceives the risks of invasive species and whether this perceived risk is consistent across species. The primary objective of this project is to assess how prospect theory applies to environmental problems that are not yet politicized. Additionally this project has practical implications for how managers can frame and message about invasive species to garner public support for management. To test the role of prospect theory in invasive species management an online panel survey will be conducted with a two by two factorial design measuring levels of support for invasive species management when it is framed in terms of the ecological or economic risks associated with the gains or losses of management. A single survey will be conducted for each species for a total of four surveys conducted. The results will be pooled once all surveys are conducted. ,2018,2020

Santa Barbara U.C. Extension and U.W. Seattle proposes to identify land management strategies that will mitigate the risk and the impacts of wildfires. Federal and state agencies apply fuel treatment techniques such as thinning and controlled burns. Fuel treatments often generate unintended consequences for humans and ecosystems because neither the agencies nor the research community fully understands the interactions among fire vegetation and ecosystem services. Furthermore agency decision makers may make decisions about fuel treatments on the basis of economic and political dynamics rather than on the basis of the best science. To assess the consequences of current fuel treatment decisions and facilitate alternative strategies the proposing team will integrate an empirical socio-economic analysis of agency decision making with RHESSys a premier physical model of the linkages between ecological and hydrological processes. ,2015,2020

There are some facilities whose pollution burden on the environment is egregious compared to peer facilities. Freudenburg (2005) termed this pattern disproportionality in the production of pollution. Disproportionality as a measure to characterize inequality in the production of pollution is gaining ground in organizational research on society and the environment. Studies of disproportionality have been conducted for the primary metals industry (Freudenburg 2005) the dairy industry (Collins 2012) the electric utility industry (Grant et al. 2013) and comparatively across a range of industries (Collins forthcoming) and they all confirm the disproportionality pattern. However such studies take a cross-sectional approach analyzing disproportionality at one point in time. This research proposes a longitudinal comparative mixed-methods approach investigating the social structures and contexts that affect if how and under what circumstances disproportionality changes over time. The research focuses on three questions: 1) How does disproportionality in the production of pollution change over time? 2) What drives those changes? and 3) What factors account for the persistence of egregious polluters? These questions are answered by analyzing facility-level toxic chemical emissions data reported to the US EPA's Toxics Release Inventory from 1988 to 2012 for three industry classifications- pulp and paper milling (NAICS 3221) printed circuit board manufacturing (NAICS 334412) and PVC pipe manufacturing (NAICS 326122). ,2016,2020

The GU is one of the most geologically significant and largest temporal gaps in the rock record marking the boundary between Precambrian and Phanerozoic time. It has been proposed that erosion below the GU delivered bio-limiting phosphorous to the ocean which spurred organic carbon burial oxygenation of the ocean-atmosphere system and the rise of animals. Determining when the GU developed (whether during Rodinia mantle upwelling early Rodinia breakup the Cryogenian Snowball Earth glaciations or Late Ediacaran rifting) and deciphering the size of the last erosion event preceding GU formation (whether km's or 100s of m) are critical for identifying viable mechanisms for evolutionary change during this pivotal interval of Earth history. However because the temporal gap across the GU is so substantial the timing and magnitude of erosion under the GU are largely unconstrained. Recent advances in (U-Th)/He thermochronology allow access to the thermal histories required to unravel the history of this iconic feature. This proposal outlines a strategy to acquire zircon and titanite (U-Th)/He data for samples along two regional transects characterized by minimal post-GU burial overprinting from: (1) the Superior Craton eastward across the Appalachian margin; and (2) the Kalahari craton westward to the Gariep belt. These transects are designed to capitalize on the PIs' collective experience working in these regions. Study sites will be targeted to fully exploit Neoproterozoic and Cambrian geologic constraints which will be vital for narrowing the range of viable thermal histories to enable discrimination between GU formation models. The results will dramatically improve constraints on the Neoproterozoic cooling   history of each margin which will be used to test competing models for GU development and significance.,2018,2020

Miss Cardenas is a Hispanic first-generation college student who has been working in our lab since January 2019. Miss Chang is a Chinese-American first-generation student who has been working in our lab since August 2018. This REU will supplement the current NSF EAGER grant 1841715 Does host specificity drive species diversification of fungal endophytes? which explores species diversity of fungi living inside of plant tissues by combining high-throughput sequencing culturing and host plant metadata. The EAGER project has so far isolated hundreds of fungal strains indicating various levels of host specificity from diverse conifer species from China and Europe. The REU project lead by Miss Cardenas will further explore the enzymatic diversity of the fungi collected during the EAGER project using a microplate spectrophotometer. Her work will test the hypothesis that host-specific fungi harbor enzymes to decompose plant material such as lignin. Additionally while the original EAGER project proposed to focus on a particular pine-specific genus the Lophodermium the REU project lead by Miss Chang will focus on the many other fungal genera that were unexpectedly and commonly found across our plant samples. Both students will be invited to continue participating in research during the fall academic quarter of 2019 and encouraged to present their findings at local and regional conferences as well as participate in the preparation of manuscripts summarizing results from the EAGER project. ,2018,2020

A better understanding of their host associations and ecological functions has important and far-reaching implications for medicine industry agriculture multiple ecosystem functions (e.g. decomposition) and conservation of species diversity. A growing body of exploratory studies suggests that some of these fungi are host-specific and have adapted to a unique life history in which they reproduce during a critical period of host senescence. This project will test how host-specific adaptations such as their ability to degrade and reproduce in host litter may drive their species diversification. This project develops a model endophyte system by generating phylogenetic genomic and transcriptomic data from a global representation of the Lophodermium-Pinus symbiosis to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying diversification of fungal endophytes. The goal is to understand significant endophyte adaptations across diverse host lineages and assess the evolutionary history of the adaptive trait within a phylogenetic and genomic framework of the endophyte. Aim 1 is focused on community and phylogenetic diversity of the associations at a global scale and includes the development of a potentially transformative cyber-platform for the synthesis of systematic data. In Aim 2 the project integrates taxonomic genomic and transcriptomic dimensions by identifying key genetic changes across multiple Lophodermium lineages correlating with changes in host-specificity. A transcriptomic analysis of endophyte tissues embedded within the host complemented with novel in situ tools will help push the boundaries of molecular and microscopic tools for the study of fungal endophytes. ,2018,2020

Specifically this project will test the hypothesis that newly identified active crustal faults on Vancouver Island British Columbia Canada accommodate right-lateral transpression and contribute to active oroclinal bending in response to the slab-parallel component of relative plate motion. To test this hypothesis we will determine fault kinematics and the Holocene slip history of three prominent outer forearc structures using a combination of bedrock mapping and structural analysis surficial mapping of offset Quaternary deposits and exploratory paleoseismic trenches. This work will also provide the first constraints on the seismic hazard posed by crustal faults in populated areas of southern British Columbia and will train undergraduate and graduate students in the identification and characterization of active shallow faults. ,2018,2021

Rift zones exhibit marked variability in terms of extension rate magmatism pre-existing structure and temporal evolution and initial conditions and geologic idiosyncrasies likely play a key role in rift dynamics. Therefore understanding the entire extensional system  from rift axis to flank  is critical. Our study will explore extensional deformation of mantle lithosphere and the crust: how strain varies with distance from the axis whether along-axis heterogeneity is a function of time or pre-existing conditions and how extension is accommodated at crustal versus mantle depths. This work will help us ascertain whether rifting is controlled by shallow or deeper processes with an emphasis on the location of melt and its role in modifying lithospheric strength at different depths. This project entails seismic imaging in the Main Ethiopian Rift (MER) and Gulf of Aden (GoA) out to the rift margins. In addition to data from existing experiments since 2001 this project will utilize a new dataset collected by Keranen that extends seismic coverage of the MER to ~500 km off the rift axis. The wide aperture array is critical to constrain pre-rifted structure that may control rift dynamics as well as to image the geodynamically-crucial transitional zone between rift and flank. By comparing the incipient MER and the more mature GoA we will elucidate the time-dependency of lithospheric strain geometry. The proposed imaging comprises simultaneous inversion of P and S receiver functions with Rayleigh wave phase velocities within a Bayesian framework; this approach is ideally suited to constrain lithologic/seismic discontinuities the presence of melt and complex 3-D rift structure. Anisotropic body wave inversions and splitting studies will help constrain the locus of melt as well as the time-integrated strain history of this rift. ,2018,2021

We will put circulation changes in the Arctic and the related climate shift over the last 40 years into a longer term 117 years context to better understand the relative contributions of anthropogenic and internal variability though analyses of observations and model simulations.

Tropical systems are under-represented in these analyses and floodplains are often the largest aquatic ecosystem in these regions. Among tropical river systems the Amazon basin is the largest and has extensive floodplains.

The primary target is to image putative small-scale convection beneath the oceanic plate that may give rise to distinctive gravitational lineations. Numerous secondary targets include: investigation of the poorly understood base of tectonic plates (the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary); analysis of rock fabrics and anelasticity that can inform us about the distribution of melt and the deformation history of the plate; and refining our limited understanding of plate ageing processes. The two ocean bottom seismic instrument deployments will contribute towards an international effort to instrument better the Pacific ocean basin in order to improve global seismological coverage that currently limits community Earth models. The relatively remote field locations were selected to significantly expand existing instrumental coverage and to interrogate potential small-scale convection structures. UCSB will be one of three US institutions responsible for this portion of the international Pacific Array campaign; the other institutions are LDEO Columbia University and Brown University.

Data to be collected include the age and elevation of raised beaches ground-penetrating radar profiles through the raised beaches and the roundness of cobbles and the lithology of ice-rafted debris found on those raised beaches. With this data we will test three hypotheses: (1) uplift rates have increased in modern times relative to the late Holocene across the Antarctic Peninsula (2) the sea-level history at the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula is distinctly different than that of the South Shetland Islands and (3) cobble roundness and the source of ice-rafted debris on raised beaches varied systematically through time reflecting the climate history of the northern Antarctic Peninsula. ,2017,2021
351p,Brad Hacker,9/1/18,8/31/21,91110,National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,1829426,Collaborative Research: Structure and dynamics of the Alaska mantle wedge,The Alaskan subduction system is one of the planet's archetypal subduction zones and studies here are the basis of much first-order understanding of subduction dynamics. The Alaska Transportable Array combined with several dense portable broadband experiments (BEAAR SALMON MOOS WVLF) achieves unprecedented sampling of seismic wave propagation in the Alaska subduction zone. This proposal takes advantage of these data to test fundamental hypotheses regarding subduction structure and dynamics. The proposed project integrates new seismic observations state-of-the-art wavefield simulations and petrologically consistent models of subduction-zone mantle structure to test these hypotheses. It focuses on three distinct corridors for which EarthScope and related projects provide unusually good sampling: (a) the Cook Inlet corridor where normal Pacific lithosphere subducts and the arc is robust; (b) the nearly amagmatic Denali corridor where the Yakutat oceanic plateau subducts and generates intermediate-depth earthquakes; and (c) the Wrangell Volcanic Field corridor where slab seismicity is nearly absent but there is very high-volume volcanism. Observations of seismic attenuation provide proxies for thermal structure and melt abundance and observations of shear-wave splitting constrain the anisotropic fabric and its variation between hot and cold parts of the mantle wedge. Parallel observations of seismicity and high-frequency phases that interact with the slab surface then allow Inferences about the mantle wedge to be compared with slab dehydration. High-frequency wavefield simulations of split shear waves will assess the maximum depth of a supra-slab anisotropic slow layer a probable signature of slab-mantle coupling depth. ,2018,2021
352p,Matthew Jackson,5/1/19,4/30/22,98714,National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,1900652,Collaborative Proposal:Deciphering the LLSVP-plume relationship,Amongst the most enigmatic aspects of the mantle are anomalously low shear wave velocity provinces (LLSVPs) whose origin composition dynamics and interaction with the mantle remain controversial. LLSVPs have been suggested to control the distribution and chemistry of hot spots. For example it has been suggested that plumes form predominantly at the edges of LLSVPs and that entrainment from the edges of LLSVPs causes the distinct chemical asymmetry observed at many hotspots. Elucidating how LLSVPs control plume location and entrainment can explain both geochemical observations at hotspots and provide crucial information on the nature and composition of LLSVPs. We are proposing an experimental fluid dynamical study to explore how three proposed LLSVP structures control and interact with mantle plumes. These three structures represent the range of LLSVP formation hypotheses so far proposed: a) purely thermal; b) dense and deformable; c) undeformable and uncoupled. We will use state-of-the-art visualization tools including scanning particle image velocimetry and thermometry to measure the three-dimensional temperature and flow fields laser induced fluorescence and Lagrangian analysis tools to locate plumes and quantify entrainment to very high spatial and temporal resolutions. We will use idealized and realistic LLSVP geometries derived from seismic tomography to make predictions about plume location and material entrainment. We seek to test both location control and whether entrainment at the edges explains the observed chemical asymmetry in hotspot lavas. ,2019,2022

In agriculture ENMs are used in biosensing enhanced nutrient transport and improved pathogen protection by controlling size surface charge polarity and electronic properties. However their proposed applications and associated responses are mostly based on assumptions that ENMs are taken up by terrestrial plants via diffusion of constituent ions through stomatal openings on leaves root epidermis or tissue injury. The dissolved ions or bio-transformed ENMs are anticipated to move through the apoplast to reach the plant vascular system following the established route of mineral nutrients through ion channels. There is limited understanding and no conclusive evidence yet on the mode of entry of ENMs and subsequent transport in plants. Advanced spectroscopic and microscopic techniques have been used to locate ENMs and transformed species within plants; however despite the depth and precision of these powerful techniques they are limited by resolution sampling bias analytical costs high exposure concentrations and sample preparation artefacts. In addition the current literature is contradictory with regards to the transport kinetics and reported mechanisms differ with plant species exposure conditions as well as growth medium. This gap in the understanding of nano-plant interaction limits utilizing ENMs in agricultural applications at their utmost potential. Sensitive endpoints at a molecular level are needed to identify the biomarkers associated with ENM cellular transport. We propose to use -omic approaches to elucidate the mode of uptake of metal based nanoparticles (MNPs) by crop plants. Our primary objectives are to: (1) characterize MNPs in natural exposure conditions and in vivo; (2) apply discovery proteomic tools to identify plasma membrane and apoplastic proteins involved in cellular uptake and transport of MNPs in plants; (3) apply untargeted metabolomics to identify metabolite regulation in plant tissues involved with MNP uptake and localization; (4) validate the candidate biomarkers using targeted proteomics and metabolomics. To address these objectives we propose root and foliar exposure of three crops (soybean corn and lettuce) grown in artificial soil medium. The plants will be exposed to MNPs such as Cu(OH)2 MoO3 Mn3O4 and CeO2 at environmentally relevant concentrations. Plant plasma membrane proteins (IMPs) and apoplastic proteins (APs) are critical candidates for this study as they participate in communication between cells and extracellular environment ion transport protein translocation/integration and signal transduction. To achieve our goal the IMPs and APs in roots and leaves from respective root and foliar exposures will be selectively enriched in our sample pool which will then be used for discovery proteomics. The tissue metabolites will also be collected and fractionated into hydrophilic and hydrophobic components for untargeted metabolomics. Advanced high-throughput liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) will be employed for the untargeted proteomics and metabolomics. Upon initial screening the candidate proteins and metabolites will be validated and quantified using targeted approaches across different exposure period and concentrations followed by meta-data integration to identify universal biomarker of MNP exposure. This workflow has been shown to be effective for drug development and targeted delivery in humans; thus it is a logical approach for elucidating MNP transport and effects mechanisms in plants. ,2019,2022

Regional and Remote,This CAREER (Faculty Early Career Development Program) project would support a 5-year comprehensive research program integrated with a range of undergraduate and graduate educational activities led by Prof. Robin Matoza at the Department of Earth Science University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB). This is the first and last attempt at an NSF CAREER proposal by PI Matoza given the eligibility criteria. I propose a comprehensive research program on the source propagation and remote detection and quantification of the seismo-acoustic signatures of volcanic unrest and eruption. We will collect next-generation multi-parametric seismo-acoustic geophysical field data from active volcanoes in Vanuatu Mexico and Chile at local (15 km) regional (15250 km) and remote (>250 km) distances from the source. In tandem we will develop an array of computationally intensive data processing methodologies and modeling and inversion strategies to systematically mine large volcano seismo-acoustic datasets and test multiple scientific hypotheses about the source and propagation of these wavefields. Intellectual Merit This project will focus on the seismo-acoustic signatures of explosive eruptions (Strombolian Vulcanian Plinian) including pre-eruptive co-eruptive and post-eruptive seismicity and infrasound. Specifically we will investigate: (1) Source directivity of volcanic explosions; (2) Seismo-acoustic wave partitioning conversion and coupling; (3) Non-linear infrasound propagation; (4) The influence of topography and atmospheric structure on infrasound propagation from volcanic explosions; and (5) the capability of regional and remote seismo-acoustic networks to detect locate characterize and catalog explosive eruptions. We will work toward these goals using a combination of new and existing data. Existing data includes growing volumes of continuous seismo-acoustic waveform data available e.g. at the IRIS Data Management Center (DMC). New data will be collected in targeted local and regional multi-parametric field experiments at Yasur and Ambrym volcanoes Vanuatu; and Popocatepetl volcano Mexico. We will also deploy a new regional infrasound array in Chile. Our Vanuatu field deployments will combine ground-based broadband seismic and infrasonic networks in tandem with multiple novel airborne infrasound tethered-balloon (aerostat) acquisition systems together with 3D aerial (drone) imaging and other multi-parametic data. All data from our experiments will be made publicly available e.g. at the IRIS DMC. Broader Impacts Undergraduate and graduate education training and mentorship are integral and central to this research project. Each geophysics field experiment team will include up to five undergraduates and two graduate students from UCSB and the experiments will involve significant international collaboration with multiple researchers and graduate students from the US New Zealand Vanuatu Mexico and Chile. These field experiments will represent the capstone experience of the geophysics undergraduates at UCSB. The students will prepare for this field research experience through a series of classes and a special new graduate seminar series Field studies in geophysics taught by the PI. Funds are requested to support two graduate students and to support undergraduate summer research projects analyzing the field data. Data examples and results from this research will be integrated into computer practicals lectures section exercises and readings in lower and upper division undergraduate and graduate classes offered by PI Matoza. In the field we will collect geo-referenced video data from novel 360˚ (virtual reality capable) cameras unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) and other systems allowing us to create rich immersive material for virtual field trip exercises that will share the excitement of volcano geophysics fieldwork and scientific discovery to General Education (GE) undergraduate students at UCSB and elsewhere.

These field sites the Wildlife Liquefaction Array the Borrego Valley Downhole Array the Garner Valley Downhole Array the Hollister Earthquake Observatory the Seattle Liquefaction Array and the Delaney Park Array are geographically distributed throughout the most hazardous part of the United States including three sites in southern California one site in central California one Pacific Northwest site in Seattle and one site in Anchorage Alaska. The design objective of these sites was to capture the penultimate earthquake in each region and instrumental observations of the earthquake effects associated with such events. The broader objective is to capture a suite of earthquakes covering a range of ground motions and strain levels at each of these sites to enable calibration of ground motion prediction models that include the effects of the near-surface geology from linear through nonlinear behavior. The California sites are operated solely by UCSB while the Seattle and Anchorage sites are operated by the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network (PNSN) and the United States Geological Survey (USGS) respectively with some assistance from UCSB. The data from all six of these facilities flows in real-time to UCSB and is disseminated along with the relevant metadata at the UCSB geotechnical array data portal (http://www.nees.ucsb.edu/data-portal). Contributing to the development and validation of models for site response liquefaction initiation ground displacements and settlement and soil-foundation-structure interaction effects are the primary goals of this observation and analysis effort. ,2015,2017

Existing circulation studies in major straits focus on the overall transport between connected basins and annual timescales. The submeso	scale flow within ocean straits is scarcely sampled, poorly understood, and not adequately resolved in ocean models.

The overall objective of the research is an observational understanding of meso	 and submeso	scale transient features that occur in the Lombok Strait circulation.

The fundamental product is the fractional snow cover (i.e. the fraction of each pixel covered by snow) and its broadband albedo derived from the grain size and contaminant amount. The main source of unclassified data is MODIS NASA‚Äôs Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer but the methods would apply to any multispectral sensor with wavelength bands in the visible near-infrared and shortwave infrared. The technique we use is spectral unmixing choosing a snow endmember that results in the smallest RMS error. In addition to the snow cover and albedo mapped from a single image we will also develop methods for space-time interpolation when we have a time series of images for example daily MODIS data. Such interpolation is necessary because snow is dynamic changing at a slower time scale than atmospheric phenomena but faster than other surface covers. Sensor noise cloud cover and viewing geometry all affect a single image so a best estimate based on the time series is a more useful product. We use a combination of smoothing splines in the time dimension with q- hull interpolation in the spatial dimension. The work is applicable to a wide range of problems in hydrology climate and transport.,2007,2010

During the project period our working group convened in person six times. A total of 31 individuals participated in these meetings: 17 based at universities (10 in the United States); five based at aquaria zoological societies or museums (four in the United States); two based at other research organizations (one in the United States); five based at resource agencies in the United States; and two with the Navy. We simplified and increased the generality of a conceptual model developed by the National Research Council (NRC) in 2005 to structure studies of the potential population-level effects of changes in behavior of marine mammals which they called population consequences of acoustic disturbance (PCAD). The NRC committee identified several levels at which anthropogenic sound may affect marine mammals including behavior (e.g. diving resting orientation) life functions (e.g. feeding breeding migrating) vital rates (e.g. adult survival reproduction) and populations (e.g. growth rate structure extirpation). Sound is one of many disturbances that ultimately may affect population dynamics and persistence.

The work will investigate feedbacks on submesoscale processes due to wave-current interactions. The Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) will be coupled to a wave model to study realistic wave-current interactions over the mid and inner continental shelf. The wave model will be validated in conditions with significant wave-current interactions including both current-induced refraction and direct forcing by surface currents against existing field observations. Coupled simulations will be carried out to investigate wave-current interactions and feedbacks over regions of elevated submesoscale activity. The coupled model will be validated against field observations collected during the DRI. The simulations will enable investigation of the importance of vortex forces on submesoscale processes. The resulting coupled model will provide a numerical framework for future capability expansion to incorporate additional effects of waves on currents such as modulation of the surface stress and mixing due to breaking and non-breaking waves. ,2016,2019

With the exception of UC Berkeley’s Consortium of Natural History Museums, CCBER is unique in its multiple roles of 1) curating, under one administrative structure, diverse biological research collections that are integrated into the teaching and research 224 missions of the University of California; 2) directing ecological restoration projects that rely on the collections for biodiversity data; and 3) offering specimen-based K-12 education, scientific workshops, and evening seminars open to the public. Although our vertebrate collections are modest in size, they represent both a thorough synoptic collection for specimen based teaching and strong regional collections for research in evolution, ecology and biogeography. The vertebrate collections have been used for research purposes mostly by students associated with the curators. They are used by academic personnel in several departments both at UCSB and elsewhere for teaching, by the general public for conservation-based education, and for our K-12 environmental education program, Kids in Nature. The herpetology collection (over 13,000 catalogued specimens of amphibians and reptiles) was started in 1977 to serve both research and teaching needs. The UCSB herpetological collections are focused on southwestern California, a region that is significantly underrepresented elsewhere, yet contains the contact areas for most of the state's main zoogeographic regions (i.e., the Coast Ranges, San Joaquin Valley, Sierra Nevada, Mojave Desert, Transverse Ranges, and southern coastal plain). Southwestern California is at the hub of rapid tectonic and regional climate changes that are driving phylogeographic patterning in a majority of the resident species. The collection has had two primary foci. From 1977-1990 the primary emphasis was on collection-building, targeting remote areas, ecotones, relict populations, and areas soon to be alienated as natural habitat. Targeted work was directed at intergrade zones in a number of reptile taxa and isolated habitat areas with unusual species compositions, as well as towards building useful series of hard-to-collect species. Since about 1990 the emphasis has shifted to documentation of the distributions and life histories of regionally declining, threatened, and endangered species. Life history materials, particularly for amphibians, are seldom well represented in western North American collections, and the CCBER collection has strength in this area. Some of the most compelling arguments for federal listing of amphibian and reptile species in southern California have depended on the vouchers and data housed in CCBER, and in the current regulatory environment, these vouchers have been invaluable to state and federal agencies. Herpetological specimens were used in providing some of the biological and distributional data that resulted in the official listing of the California Tiger Salamander (Ambystoma californiense) and the Arroyo Toad (Bufo microscaphus californicus) as endangered species by the US Fish and Wildlife Service (see Sweet, 1991 1993, and Jennings 1994). Dr. Sam Sweet regularly uses the collection in his upper division courses at UCSB and to educate agency biologists regarding species of critical concern for this region and for general identification workshops. Most of the specimens are preserved in 70% denatured ethanol, and some in 10% in formaldehyde. The CCBER ornithology collection (6245 catalogued specimens) and mammal collection (1,745 specimens) are important regional collections that will exhibit modest, targeted growth in the future. The collections were started by Drs. Mary Erickson and Barbara DeWolfe, former faculty members in the department of Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology (EEMB). The mammal collection includes 172 addition, our website contains images and information on the collections, and the library and archives are used by campus and community members. Our award winning “Kids in Nature” program (received 2007 Governor’s award in Environmental Education) with over 100 5th graders enrolled as well as other K-12 classes visit our museum several times each year and participate in hands-on activities with various collections.

For the past two years, we have focused on improving collection usage and collection management procedures such as documentation, data accessibility, and preservation of our collections through museum best practices. As part of our strategic plan, in 2008 we asked an external review panel of university 225 faculty from across the country to meet with our faculty curators, our directors and key staff (Goal 8). Their invaluable experience with university natural history collections similar to ours provided us with recommendations in several key areas: improving staffing and storage space for all collections, databasing of all biological specimens and uploading them to appropriate federated databases, and increasing faculty use of the collections campus-wide. We also successfully established a formal curator title on the UCSB campus (a two-year process) that will acknowledge the contributions of the faculty curators during their merit review process and appointed three new adjunct curators and three affiliates to CCBER.",2011,2014

Natural history collections represent the irreplaceable documentation of life on Earth. The Digitization of the UCSB Vascular Plant Collection project will provide UCSB faculty, students, CCBER staff, environmental consultants and the general public with access to these valuable and historically significant collections but also contribute to a larger effort worldwide to digitize millions of biological specimens as quickly and efficiently as possible. The project will also provide the opportunity for student interns to learn new skills and increase their interest in the work to pursue employment or advanced degrees in museum studies or collection management. The Cheadle Center's lack of funding for steady employment of a data entry technician coupled with current data entry protocols indicate a best case scenario of over seven years to complete the databasing of the remaining mounted 57,295 specimens. Our challenge is to make the data available in the most timely way. This will be done by adopting new workflows to capture label data from digital images and using optical character recognition software that can be entered directly into our database, thus reducing keystrokes and improving our hourly rates of data entry. The project goals and activities will be accomplished in one year by hiring an imaging technician who will take digital images of all catalogued sheets and enter specimen data, a project manager who will process images, enter data, and manage image and data uploads into a Specify database, and student interns who will do data entry. In addition, a taxonomist will oversee the curation, mounting, and cataloging of an additional 6200 backlogged specimens and will begin georeferencing completed records. At the end of the project, images and specimen data will be available through a Specify web portal on our web site. Completed California specimen records will also be uploaded to the Consortium of California Herbaria database, while additional specimens that are subsequently georeferenced will also be available to export to additional federated databases, such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) to be repurposed for use in floras, species lists, and historical distribution studies. The intended results of this project are: 1) improved databasing protocols and increased output leading to completion of the vascular plant collection 2) 71,600 herbarium sheet images available for online identification and assistance in refining loans to relevant specimens 3) 226 increased preservation of specimens by reduced handling over time 4) availability of new data sets for regional and statewide biodiversity studies and 5) increased potential workforce by retaining and educating interns. Additional benefits include improved loan management and tracking and safer long-term backup for images and data. We will evaluate and measure the success of our project through daily statistics, quality checking and modification of protocols as needed to accomplish our goals, monthly review of project activities and progress, and yearly performance evaluations. The Cheadle Center's primary collection management goals are to prepare, organize, and catalog collections for greater accessibility and to make specimen data available online for all of our audiences.

Dr. Adrian Wenner developed the collection as part of a UCSB general entomology course that he taught from 1961 until he retired in 1993. The majority of the specimens were collected on UCSB campus and the UCSB Natural Reserve System habitats; consequently he created an important natural history archive that is valuable to ongoing regional ecological restoration research initiatives. In this project we propose to: 1) curate barcode image database and georeference the existing 9000 insect specimens in the collection 2) disseminate the information broadly to national and international specimen data resources 3) develop an insect curation skills course as part of the already established and successful Curation of Natural History Collections course offered by the Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration 4) create a manual on contemporary practices for curating and digitizing insect collections for small museums and 5) provide workshops on insect identification and insect biodiversity. The project will be devoted to the moving of the insects into new cabinets and taxonomic identification for reorganization of the collection; barcoding imaging and label transcription to database the specimens; and finding decimal geographical coordinates that match the specimen locality labels. Concurrent to these activities we will develop and teach the Curation of Natural History Collections course on insect curation skills and recruit student interns to work in the collection. The course will be offered in winter quarter 2017 and fall quarter 2017. In winter quarter 2017 and 2018 we will provide workshops on insect identification and biodiversity for CCBER restoration staff UC Santa Barbara Natural Reserve System staff and other interested university staff faculty and students. ,2016,2019

The work also includes a science delivery task to pipeline weather model outputs to fire managers to aid in fire management planning for incidents and prescribed fire operations. The occurrence of Santa Ana wind events in Southern California significantly enhances the damage potential of wildfires under such conditions. Santa Ana winds register higher than average speeds and drier than normal humidities either one of which creates favorable burning conditions. This research will develop greater spatial and temporal details of Santa Ana events than currently available climatologies for Southern California. It will also explore new methods to model Santa Anas for fire management applications through: 1) Investigation of spatial and temporal variability of Santa Ana events over southern California; 2) Development of downscaling methods to increase spatial resolution of existing models; 3) Comparing simulations as described with an improved version of RAMS developed in Brazil; and 4) Providing assistance to unit's other cooperators engaged in extracting MM5 forecasts for FARSITE.,2006,2011

Increasing demand for this limited resource requires improved management including simulation models that describe the timing and availability and quality of water in the region. The Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed (RCEW) is the most intensively monitored watershed in the region and has a 48-year data record. We are able to effectively and accurately simulate the distribution of precipitation snow deposition and melt soil moisture and streamflow within the RCEW. It is not clear how to extend these findings over wider regions within the semi-arid Great Basin in the western US. While the cost of duplicating the detailed measurement and monitoring programs in place within RCEW to other mountainous drainages within the Western US is prohibitive the National Science Foundation (NSF) WATer and Environmental Research Systems (WATERS) Network has requested that ARS join them in undertaking an effort determine which measurements and the critical measurement density required to extend the detailed information available within RCEW to other mountain drainages across the Western US. This project will: 1) Apply the modified Penn State Integrated Hydrology Modeling (PIHM) system over RCEW using all available data; 2) Selectively reduce input data to determine the minimum input forcing data required to achieve acceptable simulation accuracy; 3) Recommend augmentation of existing measurement facilities and models that would be required to achieve this level of simulation accuracy over other mountain drainages in the Western US.,2008,2011

However these forests are denser than historical forests leaving them unhealthy and at risk for drought and wildfire. Forest thinning can increase forest health but the mountainous terrain of the Pacific Northwest makes it difficult to know where thinning will maximize forest resilience. Forest owners and managers have identified the need for management-relevant scientific information at the appropriate scale. The goal of the following integrated postdoctoral fellowship is to identify forest thinning strategies that maximize dry forest resilience through research and extension with forest owners. The integrated project has two over-arching objectives within research and extension: a) assess the ability of forest thinning strategies to reduce drought vulnerability and increase streamflow resilience; b) increase understanding of forest thinning impacts and implementation of thinning strategies among forest owners and managers. I will simulate forest hydrological and ecological processes in three watersheds in Washington and Idaho. I will establish three longitudinal workshop groups with forest owners in each of the watersheds.

This work will focus on drought-prone ecosystems where prolonged dry periods affect riparian habitat quantity and quality thereby limiting their role as thermal and moisture refugia for many threatened and endangered (T&E) species such as passerine songbirds and amphibians. Drought stress affects the extent functioning and sustainability of riparian habitats for T&E species which are of great management concern on DoD bases. However there are currently limited tools available for developing sustainable long-term riparian habitat management plans that are responsive to changes in the mean state and variability of climate. Our project will detect and assess the responses of sensitive riparian forests to drought stress over recent decades and will generalize these responses through modeling of a warming/drying climate punctuated by variable rainfall. ,2018,2022

These data provide the constraints for our geohydrologic models that are being developed to predict fluid pressures multiphase fluid saturations rates and patterns of deformation and fluid flow subsurface temperature geothermal heat flow and fluid geochemistry associated with large fault systems. In past DOE-sponsored research we mathematically modeled reactions associated with the transport of petroleum SBB-sourced methane and meteoric groundwater mixing in faulted submarine reservoirs which are partially uplifted along coastal Santa Barbara. This fluid mixing simulation resulted in carbonate mineralization along the Carneros-Refugio fault as observed in outcrops. We have also recently developed basin-scale models that incorporate coupled processes of poroelastic deformation and fluid flow as well as field-scale models of multiphase flow for the NIFZ and Long Beach fields. Applications of the discrete element deformation model RICEBAL (as developed by J.K. Morgan Rice University) are underway and these will allow us to predict the opening and closing of fault conduits as the sedimentary basins undergo extension and contraction/inversion within the California plate boundary regions. We are also currently developing a new coupled flow-heat-poroelastic deformation model TUFTS2D-FE and a multiphase flow model TUFTS2D-FV and reactive flow applications for the NIFZ in the Los Angeles basin.

Recent advances in macroalgal biofuel production techniques have spurred action to develop offshore kelp farms to utilize natural pools of available nutrients and produce kelp biomass as a novel US energy production stream. To maximize kelp biomass yields managers must be able to monitor the progression of the kelp farm starting at outplant and continuing through the growth cycle to harvest with information on biomass productivity and physiological status as well as the environmental conditions that control its near-term production. The rapid growth rate of this species along with the everpresent potential of biomass losses due to frond senescence herbivory and fouling amplify the requirement of real time autonomous monitoring data to assist in optimizing the operation of a giant kelp aquaculture farm. The Scalable Aquaculture Monitoring System (SAMS) addresses these needs by continuously assessing underwater and floating kelp biomass physiological condition and production along with the environmental factors known to affect kelp growth all while delivering relevant information to the farm manager in real time. SAMS is composed of aerial and underwater autonomous vehicles and sensors tested and validated to provide the most efficient suite of instruments delivering the required metrics at the plant scale while maintaining the scalability to monitor multiple giant kelp farms simultaneously. ,2018,2021

During the first year of this project we have identified and mapped the major seismic sources of the CFB established a relative chronology of deformation on individual faults and folds and are working to establish the tectonic framework and links to the regional geologic environment. As suggested by the previous years review panel and of critical importance to this research is establishing the Pleistocene to Holocene chronology in the fold belt. This is perhaps the most challenging part of the entire research project and if we are unable to adequately date deposits that are deformed we will be unable to estimate rates of tectonic processes which is critical to quantification of the earthquake hazard. In other words no dates no rates. Our initial project utilizes several radiocarbon dates as well as Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dates being completed by Dr. Lewis Owen at the University of Cincinnati who visited the site in March. Together we collected 12 OSL samples to place temporal limits on some of the late Pleistocene sediments. Additionally we are working in collaboration with several consulting companies who excavated three trenches across the Camarillo fold and fault. From these fault- trenches we collected several samples for dating from young steeply-tilted fluvial strata as well as two colluvial wedge deposits that we interpret to be tectonic in origin. Thus we were able to capitalize on these trenches that probably would have cost $100k and were located in exactly the place we would have attempted to investigate the fold. In the first year of our project we learned that the Saugus Fm. is critical to the long-term (105 yr) deformational history of the CFB. Most of the folds have deformed Saugus strata however the age of the Saugus Fm. is all but unknown. Dating the Saugus Fm. is a high priority and yet it lies beyond the range of most geochronometers (>200 ky). However during field work we discovered paleosols developed in and on the Saugus Fm. that are characterized by pedogenic carbonate. Similar soil carbonates as old as 600 ky have been successfully dated in the past using uranium-series dating. Given the importance of developing a reliable chronology for the Saugus Fm. we are collaborating with professors Richard Teh-Leung Ku and Shangde Luo at the University of Southern California who are experts in uranium-series dating of terrestrial deposits. This proposal seeks funds to support development of the mid-Pleistocene chronology of the Saugus Fm. Research Objectives: The objectives for the continuation of our project on the CFB are: Expand our OSL dating of the relatively younger deposits that overly the Saugus Fm. Obtain several uranium-series dates on soil carbonate horizons to determine the age of the Saugus Fm. Using the Mid-Pleistocene to Holocene chronology estimate the long-term rates magnitude and timing of active tectonics across the fold belt. Research Methods: Sample paleosols and deformed soils developed on the Saugus Fm. for uranium-series dating. Map the distribution and orientation of soils characterizing the depositional top of the Saugus Fm. Construct balanced cross-sections across the CFB tied to the Mid-Pleistocene to Holocene chronology to assess the magnitude and rates of tectonic deformation in space and time along the fold belt. Anticipated Results: The mid-Pleistocene to Holocene chronology of deformed strata and the age of the Saugus Fm in the CFB. Quantification of the magnitude timing and rates of deformation across discrete fault systems in the CFB.

However current fast finite fault solution was limited by its simple parameterization to the fault geometry i.e. a planar fault plane with constant fault strike and dip angles inferred from a point source CMT solution. As showed in our recent study of the 2007 Solomon Islands earthquake considering the down-dip variation of the fault dip angle and using a more appropriate velocity structure strongly reshapes the inverted slip distribution and ends up a 4 times difference in inverted peak slip. Attempts have been made to resolve this problem by predefining the fault geometry using relocated seismic catalog and moment tensors [Hayes and Wald 2008]. But how to incorporate these results into fast finite fault inversion is still not resolved.

The faults responsible for two regional folds adjacent to Los Angeles are not well-characterized and their activity is controversial. These structures are the Palos Verdes anticlinorium, underlain by the San Pedro Escarpment fault, and the southwest limb of the San Joaquin Hills, underlain by the Oceanside thrust. The continental slope between Newport Beach and Oceanside is the sea floor expression of the latter fold limb. The Palos Verdes anticlinorium is a 70 km-long structure located immediately adjacent to Los Angeles, with much of it lying offshore. A SW-dipping backthrust had previously been proposed beneath the southwest limb, and recently a SW-dipping normal-separation fault has been proposed as the principle fault along the base of the fold limb. An alternate interpretation is possible: NE-dipping blind and partly blind (oblique) thrust faults, including the San Pedro Escarpment fault, underlie the anticlinorium, and align in 3D with the controversial Compton thrust beneath Los Angeles. The larger area of the proposed combined fault, as well as the opposite dip and/or slip sense of its shallow offshore part, would have critical implications for earthquake hazard. These include duration, location, and amplitude of strong ground motion above the deep sedimentary basin on which the Los Angeles metropolitan area is built. Thrust uplift of San Pedro Shelf and of the Shelf Projection in Santa Monica Bay could generate large local tsunamis. Digital representations of faults and stratigraphic horizons will be made available to the U.S.G.S for tsunami source characterization work as part of the Multi-Hazards Demonstration Project for southern California.",2008,2009

Accurate knowledge of the ocean surface current field is necessary for predicting the path of spilled oil. The MMS has thus been actively funding ocean circulation studies in the Santa Barbara Channel since at least the historical 1969 oil spill to understand how wind and pressure driven currents combine with transient mesoscale eddies and other motions to comprise the local circulation patterns. Although the number of oil/gas leases in the Santa Barbara channel is presently being reduced, an understanding of current patterns is still necessary for spill risk assessment, for monitoring natural seepage, and for determining how nutrients, larvae, and contaminants move to marine habitat around obsolete structures as part of the MMS Rigs-to- Reefs program (http://www.gomr.mms.gov/homepg/regulate/environ/rigs-to- reefs/information.html). During the last 10 years, the MMS has sponsored the Santa Barbara Channel ? Santa Maria Basin Coastal Circulation Study (SBC-SMB CCS), a large observational program aimed at improving the understanding and predictability of large-scale circulation patterns within the study region. The ARGOS-CODE drifters used in the SBC-SMB study give position data with 1 km spatial accuracy every few hours and are not appropriate for resolving inner-shelf flow patterns. Thus, circulation patterns defined for the SBC hold only for basin-scale currents, and may not be indicative of flows over the inner-shelf. Dever et al. (1998) ultimately report that drifters over the inner-shelf “exhibited behavior quite different from drifters found in the open channel.” This leads to the questions: 1) What are the characteristic patterns of circulation over the inner-shelf? 2) How do the inner-shelf patterns relate to the basin-scale patterns reported by Winant et al. (2003)? 3) What are the dominant forcing mechanisms? This research seeks answers to these questions.",2004,2010

We propose two studies in the northern Carson-Iceberg Wilderness (central Sierra Nevada). One study will focus on mapping of paleochannnels west of the range crest where stratigraphic relations are not complicated by faults. The second study will focus on mapping of range front faults to determine their movement history and controls on Ancestral Cascades arc volcanism. Great controversy abounds regarding the age and uplift history of the longest and tallest mountain chain in the co-terminus United States the Sierra Nevada. Recent studies have mainly used laboratory and geophysical techniques to address this problem.

However fast finite fault solutions were generally limited by the simple parameterization to the fault geometry i.e. planar fault planes with constant fault strike and dip angles inferred from point source CMT solutions. Considering the down-dip variation of the fault dip angle and using a more appropriate velocity structure usually reshapes the inverted slip distribution and sometimes ends up a multiple times difference in inverted slip e.g. the 2007 Solomon Islands earthquake. Correct representation of fault geometry is also crucial for predicting the local damage and tsunami excitation. Attempts have been made to predefine the fault geometry using relocated seismic catalog and moment tensors [Hayes and Wald 2008]. But it is still lack of finite fault inverse algorithm which could easily incorporate the irregular fault plane. In a pilot study supported by the USGS we are developing the feasible mesh algorithm to consider the complex fault geometry. Here we propose to improve the solutions of quick finite fault inversion procedure and the tsunami predicting capability by considering the effect of the irregular fault surfaces.,2009,2010
380p,Ralph Archuleta,1/1/09,12/31/10,73921,US Department of Interior,Federal agencies,G09AP00027,Strong Ground Motions in Salt Lake City and Other Metropolitan Areas From Large Earthquakes on the Wasatch Fault,Nearly 80% of the population of Utah lives near the Wasatch fault (Utah Geological Survey 1996). The metropolitan areas of Salt Lake City and Provo/Orem are among the most hazardous regions of the United States (USGS 1998). Besides the question: When will the next large earthquake occur? The most important question is: What will the ground motion be? Large earthquakes even moderate sized events are relatively rare on the Wasatch fault. The geological setting‚Äîwhere most of the infrastructure and the population are sitting on alluvial filled valleys‚Äî exacerbates the situation. We propose to mitigate the seismic risk by using dynamic and kinematic simulations of different earthquake scenarios to derive estimates of the expected ground motion from large earthquakes on the Wasatch fault. These simulations will account for: 1) geometry of the fault 2) the velocity structure in particular the 3D structure with sediments juxtaposed against the granite of the mountains 3) topography 4) heterogeneous stress on the fault and 5) physics of the constitutive laws for friction. Many different earthquake scenarios based on different hypocenters and variations of the input parameters will be simulated in order to determine the range of the ground motion. These simulations will provide ground motion for frequencies up to 1-2 Hz. We will make use of the extensive investigations already done for the Wasatch fault that document the geometry of the fault active tectonics and the velocity and attenuation structure. Recent USGS funded projects will provide more details about the 3D velocity structure as well as the near-surface velocities for some limited regions. Professor Robert Smith University of Utah has been either directly or indirectly involved with most of the studies that provide these basic data. We have used the 3D community velocity model and the USGS description of the fault geometry as the baseline for our simulations. We have incorporated these features in our initial simulations of the dynamics of a spontaneously propagating fracture. We use the finite element code MAFE [Ma and Beroza 2008; Ma and Archuleta 2006; Ma et al. 2007] to simulate dynamic ruptures on dipping faults. The dynamics includes heterogeneous stress conditions and a slip weakening constitutive law for friction that couples the heterogeneous stresses on the fault with the elastic response during a spontaneous shear fracture. While this method includes the realistic effects of geology fault structure and the physics of a spontaneously propagating shear fracture the ground motion is computationally limited to frequencies less than 1-2 Hz. To extend the frequency range to higher frequencies ~10-20 Hz we will collaborate with Professor Jacobo Bielak Carnegie Mellon University who has developed a hierarchical finite element method that can take our dynamic results of faulting as input to a kinematic model and propagate the motion to higher frequencies. With many different faulting scenarios there will be many different ground motion maps. The purpose of the project is to estimate the range of ground motion that should be expected from a MW ~7 earthquake on the Wasatch Fault. Preliminary results for normal faulting earthquakes show that the ground motion on the hanging wall (the side of the fault where most of population resides) has large ground motion and long duration due both to the proximity of the fault plane and the sediment filled basin. The largest amplitudes are within ¬±5 km of the fault trace with the largest amplitudes on the vertical component. Basically we have very limited direct knowledge of what to expect from a large normal-faulting earthquake. Through simulations of many scenario earthquakes that include realistic geological structure and fault geometries we will provide robust estimates for the expected ground motion from a MW~7 earthquake on the Wasatch fault.,2009,2010

These archives have become very important to the archeological community as providing a place to find artifacts as well as a record of the changes that the early Native American people adapted to. However key to locating new sites and placing existing archeological finds into context is an understanding of the modern landscape and how the underlying geology affected the evolution of these forms. The purpose of this proposal is to map the underlying geology as well as the Quaternary terraces found along the 187 Bull Creek drainage and its confluence with the Beaver River. This project will aid a current ongoing project conducted by archeologists, soil scientist, and nanoscientists to look for nanodiamonds across the Younger Dryas Boundary within the paleosols of the Bull Creek Drainage. Nanodiamonds found by previous studies at the onset of the Younger Dryas have been used as evidence to support an impact-related cause for the extinction of some megafauna, the climatic cooling of the Younger Dryas, and the change from Folsum to Clovis societies in North America. Mapping the terraces and underlying geology for the Bull Creek Drainage will allow for a better characterization of the deposits and controls on geomorphology for this important drainage system.",2010,2011

It is the best-recorded normal faulting earthquake in terms of near-source accelerograms. Additionally it has static field measurements that include both GPS and InSAR. There are 17 strong motion accelerographs within 50 km of the surface projection of the fault. Among them 10 are within 20 km and four accelerographs are on the hanging wall above the fault plane. Prior to this earthquake there were very few near-source accelerograms for normal faulting earthquakes. In the Next Generation of Attenuation relations Excel spreadsheet that has the metadata for the accelerograms [Chiou et al. 2008] only 12 normal-faulting earthquakes (MW 6.0) are listed; from these events there are only 28 strong motion records within 50 km of the fault. Thus the results of this work will be an important addition to the dataset of normal faulting earthquakes. The basic objective of this proposed research is to invert the strong motion regional seismograms GPS vectors and InSAR data to determine the kinematic parameters that describe the faulting. We will then use that faulting model to predict the broadband ground motion by summing empirical Green‚Äôs functions based on the aftershocks recorded on the accelerographs. For the mainshock we have obtained all of the strong motion data all of the regional broadband seismograms and the regional 3D velocity structure in a 100 km x 100 km area that encompasses the epicentral region. Through our cooperation with Italian scientists (M. Cocco and R. Paolucci) at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV) in both Rome and Milano we will obtain the GPS and InSAR data. Focal mechanisms have already been published for the aftershocks with ML 4.0. To get a better description of the velocity structure in the epicentral region we will collaborate with an Italian scientist (G. De Luca) at the National Laboratory of Gran Sasso of National Institut of Nuclear Physics who has been operating a local seismic array in the Aterno Valley and has published on the local velocity structure and site effects. With these data we have the fundamental building blocks to start our analysis. Care has to be taken in various steps of the analysis and multiple approaches are possible for each step. We will explore various approaches and perform comprehensive analysis for this important normalfaulting data set. We will use two different nonlinear inversion methods [Ji et al. 2002; Liu and Archuleta 2004] to invert the data. We will include the static measurements (GPS and InSAR) in a two-step approach vis-aÃÄvis Page et al. [2009] and CustoÃÅdio et al. [2009] and also as a joint inversion vis-aÃÄ-vis Ji et al. [2002]. Given the excellent InSAR data it will be important to determine what constraints it puts on the temporal evolution of the faulting. It is well documented that many different faulting models can produce equally good low-frequency waveform fits to the seismic data. The critical questions revolve around how the velocity structure the station distribution the band-limited data etc. produce uncertainty in the spatial and temporal parameters of the faulting model. We will address these questions as we find the faulting models that are consistent with all the data. The faulting models found by inversions are limited to low frequencies generally a maximum around 1.0 Hz. By using isochrones we will do forensics on the models to evaluate their ability to predict the timing and relative amplitudes of peak velocities and acceleration. This will provide an independent check on the rupture velocity and spatial distribution of slip. To complete the study we will use aftershocks as empirical Green‚Äôs functions. We will sum the empirical Green‚Äôs functions weighted by the slip distribution and with the rupture time that was determined from the inversion. With this approach we can generate broadband synthetic time histories forcomparison with the data. We will use Fourier amplitude spectra and Husid plots to evaluate the comparison between synthetics and the data.,2010,2011
383p,Douglas Burbank,1/1/10,12/31/11,57838,US Department of Interior,Federal agencies,G10AP00015,Temporal Patterns of Fault Slip Rates on the Genoa Fault,A deeper understanding of the temporal and spatial dynamics of faults and the associated seismicity requires knowledge of the timing rate and spatial variation of tectonic processes that control the deformation. A fundamental assumption that underpins many brittle crustal deformation models is that tectonic rates are steady once integrated across a sufficient number of seismic events. Short-term interseismic deformation rates are commonly assumed to be constant across time and space and therefore can be used to predict long-term deformation patterns. We know that this assumption may well be inaccurate on million-year time scales but the ‚Äústeady rate‚Äù assumption remains largely untested at shorter time scales. Thus a tantalizing but unanswered question persists: Do deformation rates accelerate and decelerate at scales of 102 to 105 years? Using an integrated geomorphic-paleoseismic-geodetic approach our team proposes to focus on answering this question in a spatially-restricted and well-mapped region where we can quantify a record of fault-related deformation over the past 103-105 yr along the Genoa fault at the eastern boundary of the central Sierra Nevada California-Nevada. The Genoa fault is experiencing some of the highest strain rates and fastest Holocene slip rates in the western Great Basin. Whereas this fault has been the site of at least two pre-historic Holocene earthquakes M>7 its long-term slip rate history is poorly known. Over 10- to 200-ky time scales our proposed geomorphic approach is to quantify fault displacements of multiple geomorphic features including glacial outwash terraces and alluvial fans and to determine the age of those features using cosmogenic radionuclide (CRN) exposure dating techniques. By comparing offsets of different ages along individual fault segments and modeling their slip rates we will define how the locus magnitude and rate of fault slip changes through time. Paleoseismic trench studies (funded by NEHRP through our FY09 proposal) will reduce uncertainty concerning how these geomorphic offsets are produced by fault rupture. Presently funded paleoseismic excavations and mapping were an appropriate first step in constraining strain in this region and this trench data will offer a unique opportunity to compare timing of earthquake events displacement magnitude/event and geometry of underlying faults to the slip- rates calculated from offset geomorphic features (proposed in this study) on the southern segment of the Genoa fault. By integrating geologic and paleoseismic datasets we will be able to investigate what frequency and magnitudes of earthquake rupture were required to build observed geomorphic offsets. These data will be compared to modern geodetic deformation rates from a dense local GPS network in order to test models of the earthquake cycle. Despite numerous past studies the 104-105 yr time span has been poorly explored due either to the paucity of dating techniques with sufficient resolution in this interval or to the absence of datable materials. CRN dating of surface boulders and depth profiles will allow more accurate high-resolution chronologies to be developed for numerous geomorphic features that are deformed by active faults in this temporal (104-105 yr) window. This proposal intentionally focuses on field sites where slip rates are modest (generally 1-3 mm/yr). In such a region the use of multiple displaced markers with high-resolution dates will permit a robust discrimination of temporal changes in fault behavior. On rapidly moving faults temporal resolution is typically insufficient to unambiguously discriminate among such geomorphic displacement rates. Our late Quaternary data will synthesized with Holocene paleoseismic (102-103 yr) and modern geodetic rates in this same region thereby providing tests of key assumptions about the temporal constancy of slip rates.,2010,2011

In the California near-shore Inner Borderland, there are rather important differences in interpreted fault geometry and continuity, slip type, age of deformed strata, and thus fault activity. These interpretations are available in reports and publications, from 2009 and 2010. Fault databases currently do not take into account certain recent interpretations. For example, the Descanso fault has been mapped from far south in Mexican waters to 5 km offshore San Diego. An additional 30 km of this fault continues northwest of where it has been mapped before. There, it is kinematically and geometrically linked to the 70 km-long San Mateo-Carlsbad fault, which in turn is part of a 3D “Flower Structure” with the Newport-Inglewood fault.

With these new data, it is now possible to study the direct relationship between ground response and pore pressure generated by the same source. A suite of 20 events is available from liquefaction arrays, where pore pressure increases are observed and surface waves generate long-period response. Using wavelet decomposition, we propose to find a relationship between pore pressure and ground motion that includes the effects of long-period, cyclic signals. Preliminary analysis indicates that long-period motions have a 166 profound influence on pore pressure and thus must be included in a comprehensive survey of liquefaction hazard. The pore pressure response is sensitive to shear strain and peak velocity at low frequencies. The results of this study will provide a new risk assessment tool for the reduction of hazard due to liquefaction caused by large earthquakes. Data collected from recent events have demonstrated that pore pressure increase is a strain-based phenomenon that responds to long-period signals from surface waves well after the peak accelerations of an earthquake have passed. Saturated areas of western Oregon and Washington are particularly vulnerable to the effects of strong motions generated by Cascadia subduction zone events. With new data from recent events, we show that the cycles and sustained high velocities of surface waves have a dramatic effect on pore pressure increase, even in the absence of large accelerations. Our analysis of these data offers an additional tool, to be applied in conjunction with standard engineering practice, in the evaluation of the liquefaction hazard for areas in the near field (Seattle) of a M9 event.",2012,2013

California tiger salamanders are known to occur off of VAFB along Hwy 246 and near Casmalia (Sweet pers comm.) Surveys for CTS on VAFB in 2001 and 2003 were inconclusive because of the dry weather during the survey years. During dry years, CTS may not emerge and breed in pools. In 2008, the habitat capability of pools for CTS were assessed by a member of the Recovery Team, Professor Samuel Sweet of the University of California, Santa Barbara. Sweet assessed the pools based on ecological requirements of the species. For pools to be suitable, they must remain wet for a prolonged period, long enough to develop a prey base for the larval CTS. For pools to be occupied, they need to have surrounding habitat through which salamanders can disperse. The probability of occupancy increases in pools within 2 miles of occupied habitat off base. Suitable dispersal habitat needed microenvironments which were cool or shaded with gradual slopes down to the pools. The surrounding area of the pools needed friable soils or burrows which could shelter adult CTS during the nonbreeding season or years. In 2008, hoop-net and seine net samples of pools were conducted after pools had been inundated for about a month.

Their increased band gap means that they function as strong oxidizing and/or reducing agents and their small size allows them to pass into living cells. Conjugation of biomolecules to the crystal surface can alter any or all of these properties. In preliminary experiments we observed that only bioconjugated CdSe quantum dots are taken up by bacteria and eukaryotic cells. Intracellular fluorescence varies apparently by electron transfer-mediated quenching and nanoparticle breakdown. Bare quantum dots are as toxic to growing bacteria as Cd2+ implying possible extracellular breakdown but subsequent fates and toxicity relationships are unknown. Particle size dependencies are implied but insufficiently understood for use in risk analysis. A systematic inquiry into size- and chemistry-dependent uptake and fate processes is needed. We propose to quantify cellular-scale processes that affect nanoparticle entry stability and toxicity for a variety of bacterial and eukaryotic cells. We will focus on two nanoparticles CdSe whose metals are toxic and TiO2 whose toxicity arises solely from its size and electron transfer activity. Both short term ‚Äòlabeling‚Äô and longer term growth experiments will be performed to quantify particle entry into cells and toxicity; we will also study energy transfer between nanoparticles and energized membranes as a mechanism. The relative importance of near-cell breakdown whole- particle electron scavanging and intracellular particle reformation as fates will be quantified. This project will show how nanoparticles and cells may cooperate in transmembrane transport as well as toxicity. This research will be used to predict cellular-scale exposure and toxicity for bacteria and eukaryotes in soil and water.

The site was owned and operated by Casmalia Resources and accepted approximately 5.6 billion pounds of waste between 1973 and 1989. Waste disposal units at the site included: 6 landfills for pesticides/solvents, metals, caustic/cyanides, acids, and non-liquid polychlorinated biphenyls; 43 surface impoundments; 15 evaporation pads; 2 non-hazardous waste spreading areas; 6 oil field spreading areas; 11 shallow injection wells; 7 disposal trenches; 1 drum burial unit; and 6 landfills. The site supports five stormwater ponds that may serve as an attractive nuisance to wildlife. The federally endangered California tiger salamander (Ambystoma californiense) and federally threatened Calfornia red-legged frog (Rana draytonii) have been detected at the site. In 2001 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) entered into an agreement with EPA to extend a covenant not to sue for Natural Resource Damages to potentially responsible parties as part of a de minimis settlement. The Service received $178,250 in settlement funds in exchange for the issuance of the covenant not to sue. The Service intends to use these funds to conduct restoration that will benefit the California red-legged frog, California tiger salamander, and other trust resources. Biological surveys were conducted in the late 1990s and early 2000s in support of EPA’s ecological risk assessment and remedial investigation. Updated surveys are necessary in order to determine current usage of the site by our trust resources, and to best guide the use of the limited settlement dollars available to conduct restoration. The Ventura Fish and Wildlife Office proposes to use the requested funding to conduct surveys for the California red-legged frog and California tiger salamander in strategic locations within the site and surrounding habitats to determine current usage of the site by these species. Surveys for California red-legged frogs were previously conducted in 1998, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004. Surveys for California tiger salamanders were conducted in 2002/2003, and 2004/2005. California red-legged frogs were detected in all survey efforts with the exception of 2004. California tiger salamanders were detected during drift fence surveys in 2004/2005. Because California tiger salamander surveys have never been replicated at the site in the six years since the species was detected, and because the species is so acutely imperiled within Santa Barbara County, information about presence or absence of the species at the Casmalia Resources site would be invaluable. In addition, previous surveys for California tiger salamanders 210 established presence of metamorphosed individuals in upland habitat, but the extent of California tiger salamander breeding in aquatic resources at the site remains unknown. The trend in observations of California red-legged frogs throughout the 1998 to 2004 study period demonstrated a rapid decline from over 50 individuals detected in 1998 to no individuals detected in 2003 or 2004. The absence of California red-legged frogs in 2003 and 2004 is suspected to be associated with low water levels in the stormwater ponds due to pumping of water for the construction of a landfill cap, and increasing total dissolved solids (TDS) in the stormwater ponds. The water level in all ponds is currently high relative to 2003/2004, however TDS remains high and the use of the ponds by California red-legged frogs and California tiger salamanders is unknown. It is likely that the high TDS is creating an attractive nuisance for the California tiger salamanders and California red-legged frogs attempting to breed at the site. This project will evaluate the need for (through aquatic and upland surveys) and feasibility of, creating additional breeding ponds at the site to provide suitable breeding habitat away from areas with high TDS. Ponds will subsequently be created as deemed appropriate and monitored in subsequent years. The proposed surveys will assist the Service in providing technical assistance to EPA during the remedial process, and implementing restoration for the California red-legged frog and California tiger salamander.

The US Geological Survey (USGS) Research contracted with the Holden Lab at University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB) to perform microbial community analysis of water samples in the Fall of 2009 for a prior study of the Malibu Lagoon. Because microbial communities may be altered by the introduction of effluent or wastewater (i.e. via direct inoculation of waste-associated microbes or via introduction of nutrients or other chemicals that could exert selective pressures on indigenous populations) and because microbial communities can be interrogated using culture-independent methods yielding dense datasets (amenable to powerful statistical analysis by multivariate methods) assaying microbial community composition from water samples at suspected impacted positive control and negative control sites can comparatively reveal the degree of impact. The objective of this project was to analyze microbial communities that exist in water samples collected by the USGS at Malibu Lagoon in the spring of 2010. The microbial community analysis data were provided to the USGS for their statistical analysis and for comparison to other datasets they generated. The community analysis approach used here was Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (TRFLP) analysis; additionally one other DNA-based source tracking method (qPCR of a human-specific Bacteriodales gene) and qPCR of Enterococcus sp. were applied to extracted DNA to aid in assessing fecal contamination of the water samples.

The Western Mountain Initiative (WMI; http://www.cfr.washington.edu/research.fme/wmi) team explores the effects of climate change on ecological disturbance responses of forest vegetation mountain hydrology and the coupled hydro-ecological responses that determine vulnerability of Western mountain ecosystems to change. Extensive data sets empirical studies surveys and monitoring programs are linked via models to hindcast and forecast the effects of changing climate on forest dynamics distribution and productivity; fire occurrence and insect outbreaks; recovery of vegetation after disturbance; hydrologic changes and glacier dynamics; and the consequences of an altered water cycle for terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and chemistry. We will address the extent to which climate drivers are mediated by regional- or watershed-scale controls on ecosystem processes thus quantifying vulnerability to climate change in mountain ecosystems. Region-specific results and emergent West-wide patterns will be shared with resource managers through workshops and a comprehensive web-based toolkit on climate-change science and adaptation management. WMI seeks to understand climate-ecosystem interactions forecast ecological change and provide adaptation information for managers. We build on the foundation of our ongoing research program which includes hundreds of publications long-term datasets and a mature network of collaborators. WMI addresses Ecosystem and Climate Change goals of the USGS Global Change Science Strategy and Goals 4 and 5 of the U.S. Climate Change Science Program Strategic Plan. Both the National Park Service and US Forest Service are developing science-based management approaches for adapting to climate change and WMI will collaborate directly with both agencies to ensure scientific consistency in the implementation of adaptation strategies. In the preceding phase of WMI research we used RHESSys to model ecosystem processes and hydrology in five forested montane watersheds representing diverse conditions across the western U.S. (sites in MT CO NM CA WA) (Christensen et al. 2008). In addition ongoing RHESSys applications as part of other projects include a range of watersheds throughout the West (Tague et al. 2008; Tague et al. in review). Analysis at the scale of these sites (<800 km2) is critical given that management of resources takes place at small watershed scales where process-based interactions are determined by gradients in snow temperature and radiation; spatial distribution of moisture; vegetation structure and pattern; and disturbances (fire insects mass movements). This abundant RHESSys model output is ready to be carried to the next level of interpretation. Tague role in the WMI project will be to continue the refinement and application of RHESSys as a coupled eco-hydrologic model for use in hypothesis generation and scenario development. ,2010,2015

409p,Alexander Simms,8/1/14,7/31/15,19508,US Geological Survey,Federal agencies,G14AC00277,Geologic Controls on Karst in western Oklahoma,Western Oklahoma is host to over 1200 feet of interbedded shales sandstones and gypsums. The gypsums of western Oklahoma provide natural resources for local economic development but also pose a risk to transportation and other infrastructure. The area is prone to karst and similar to the neighboring Texas Panhandle the age and geologic controls on karst are still relatively poorly understood. During a mapping project of the Washita National Battlefield in western Oklahoma the PI and a former undergraduate student noted the development of inverted topography from karst. The purpose of this proposal is to expand the limited mapping (<35 km2) conducted as part of that project in order to better understand the distribution of karst landforms in the region and gain better insights into the timing and controls on karst formation in western Oklahoma. Our central hypothesis is that karst follows the major late Quaternary drainages of the region. If this is true it suggests a tie between river incision and karst in the region. However this leaves unresolved whether the karst controlled river development or river incision lead to karst formation. The relationship between karst and the other Cenozoic stratigraphic units (e.g. Neogene Ogallala Formation Quaternary Terraces) will allow for this differentiation. In order to test our central hypothesis we will map the surface geology of two quadrangles in western Oklahoma. We expect to find that the inverted topographic features within our study area created due to karst are only found along the major stream courses and the karst cross-cuts the Ogallala Formation but not the Quaternary terraces. If our hypothesis is correct that would suggest that karst in this region is no older than the stream courses. ,2014,2015

The goal of this research is to increase process understanding explaining how hydrologic and ecosystem structure and function respond to climate variability and change and land use/land cover changes in mountain environments in the Western US. Results from this work are communicated through peer-review publications and through interactions with stakeholders - including land managers and the public. A key focus of this sub-proposal is the development of process-based spatial models as tools for both scenario generation and to integrate findings from field-based research by collaborators within the WMI initiative and elsewhere. Our ongoing model development with RHESSys (Regional Hydro-Ecological Simulation System) is made available to the larger science community through publically available code and regular training sessions. There is a long-standing collaborative partnership between USGS and University of California Santa Barbara researchers to explore the effects of climate change on water resources ecosystem structure and function and disturbance regimes. Results contribute to improving understanding of how Western U.S. landscapes will respond to climate variation and change and identifying key vulnerabilities and the consequences of land management options. For example we have used model-based scenarios to quantify the contributions of underlying watershed geologic characteristics to the sensitivity of forest water use and streamflow to drought (e.g Tague and Peng 2013). Our continued development of informatics tools provides improved techniques for assessing the impacts of thinning and fuel treatments on forest drought fire risk and water resources (eg. Tague et al. 2013). By providing a coupled eco-hydrologic perspective our model scenarios provide information about the interactions among climate forest management practices and water resources that are needed for effective climate change adaptation planning. The connection with the UCSB Bren School of Environmental Science and Managements professional Masters program also provides an opportunity to communicate research findings to young environmental leaders and professionals. The Bren program is specifically designed to train environmental professionals for careers in environmental problem solving in government industry and non-profits and has a very active outreach program to these societal groups. ,2015,2016

This effort will facilitate two graduate and two undergraduate student geologic mapping projects in a portion of the footwall of the northern Snake Range Decollement (NSRD) where the Miocene extensional overprint is less pervasive and older structures and fabrics are well-preserved. The primary objectives of this project are: 1) Produce publishable digital geologic maps including two maps of key areas at 1:10000 and a compilation of new and existing mapping to complete Six Mile Canyon 7.5 Quadrangle at 1:24000 with accompanying cross-sections and technical reports and 2) Train two graduate and undergraduate students in the making of high-quality geologic maps and conducting field-based research. The four students will map independent but complementary areas: one will map an approximately 30 km2 area at 1:10000 of intensely-folded Cambrian to Ordovician marble and calc-schist that is cut by an Eocene (?) dike swarm in the northernmost part of the range. The goals are to document the fold geometry associated with Mesozoic shortening the geometry kinematics and timing of different tectonite fabrics and degree of footwall rotation. Another student (MS) will map a 35 km2 area at 1:10000 along the western flank of the range focusing on the geometry of a recently discovered east-directed thrust fault system. Two undergraduate students will be selected to join the EDMAP mapping effort for the last 4 weeks of summer to help complete the Six Mile Canyon 7.5 Quadrangle.

Although computational performances have increased exponentially in the last few years there are still strong limitations in global climate modeling in simulating regional processes on short spatial and temporal time-scales. As of today most Global Climate Models (GCMs) have typical horizontal resolution of 150-300 km with 30-50 vertical layers. Much of the improved computational resources have been used to incorporate more sophisticated physical parameterizations interactive earth system components and ensemble simulations of extended lengths. To date major model biases remain in global climate simulations that limit their ability to provide climate information with sufficient reliability and spatial specificity for societal use. Perhaps the most persistent and pervasive biases are related to the representation of the hydrological cycle. Consequences of an inaccurate hydrological cycle in fully coupled GCM simulations of the climate system are far reaching since water integrates the physical biological and chemical components. Most climate change projections are currently based on models that simulate coupled atmospheric and oceanic processes on coarse resolutions. Among the most important impacts of regional-scale predictions of climate changes is on food production and security. Simulations on regional scales of precipitation and temperature are absolutely crucial to understand how global warming will affect fresh water storage and the ability to grow potato wheat corn and other staples. Dynamical regional model simulations using GCMs as boundary conditions have been largely applied but challenges in this area still abounds. In some cases improvements to GCMs are considered marginal given the necessary computational efforts. The objective of the present work is to develop a downscaling statistical model based on wavelet- multifractal and artificial neural network approaches. The focus of this analysis will be on South America and on the regional modeling of temperature and precipitation. More specifically our objectives are: 1) Implement some existing stochastic downscaling models based on cascade techniques such as spatial disaggregation (Sharma et al. 2007) multiplicative random cascade (Srestha et al. 2004) or rainfall downscaling in a space-time multifractal (Deidda 2000). 2) Review and assess different empirical statistical downscaling models and performance of statistical downscaling models in GCM validation and regional climate change estimation. 3) Compare the empirical statistical downscaling models with simulations of the present climate with the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS) over eastern South America. 4) Elaborate a complementary new proposal to be submitted to NSF to expand the present study to other regions and meteorological variables.,2010,2012

Two critical problem areas warrant accelerated research effort: 1) incorporating vegetation response into hydrologic models to better predict availability of late summer water for human consumption and ecosystem services, and 2) developing novel and rigorous predictions of the extent of stream network changes under changing climate, with direct consequences for fish and other aquatic organisms. Dr. Tague’s research will focus on problem 1) as described below. Incorporating vegetation response into hydrologic models. Spatially distributed modeling of both vegetation and hydrology at watershed to landscape scales have matured dramatically over the past decade. Such models offer a sound basis for predicting and testing how changing climate is likely to impact water resources and forest ecosystems. In particular, the Regional Hydro-Ecologic Simulation System (RHESSys) is one of the most sophisticated models coupling hydrology, vegetation dynamics, and nutrient and carbon cycling in response to both climate and land use drivers. Our previous work with RHESSys has allowed us to make significant progress in characterizing how summer streamflow from landscapes underlain by geologies differing in their hydrologic “plumbing systems”, specifically the degree to which subsurface flow is dominated by deep or shallow groundwater systems, vary in response to climate change. We now propose to extend this work by using RHESSys to explore whether vegetation changes, including those in response to changing fire regimes, exert an equally important control on summer streamflow. We will focus on catchments in the Cascade Range of Oregon for which we have already calibrated RHESSys, thereby expediting the work, and will incorporate recent findings from the Wind River Canopy Crane and H.J. Andrews Forest to parameterize evapotranspiration (ET), soil moisture and sapflow components of the model. Results from this effort will examine how warmer climate and earlier snowmelt will affect late summer streamflow, either by changing ET or through direct vegetation change (i.e., replacement of conifers by riparian alders following disturbance).",2008,2009

Climate change directly affects the distribution and viability of sagebrush and exacerbates the influence of many existing stressors. The probability of listings of sagebrush-obligate or sagebrush-associated species including birds under federal and state endangered species acts is increasing as a result. The status of Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) is a high priority. The historical range of Greater Sage-Grouse overlapped with 12 western states and with three Canadian provinces. Greater Sage-Grouse currently occupy ~50% of their historical range and the abundances of many populations are declining by as much as 2% per year. Population trends of many other sagebrush-associated species are similar. For example abundances of populations of Brewer‚Äôs Sparrow (Spizella brewerii) have been declining by 3% per year. Whether Greater Sage- Grouse warrant listing under the U.S. Endangered Species Act has been debated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and district courts for more than five years. In the meantime efforts to conserve the species and its habitat are well underway. In June 2008 the Western Governors‚Äô Association issued Policy Resolution 08‚Äì12 Sagegrouse and Sagebrush Conservation which recognized ‚Äúa continuing need to evaluate the species‚Äô status and develop overall management criteria at the range-wide level so conservation needs and successes can be assessed.‚Äù On 29 October 2008 the Governor of Nevada announced an Executive Order declaring that the state‚Äôs policy is to preserve and protect habitat for Greater Sage-Grouse whenever possible. Prescribed fire and other fuels management treatments have been suggested as mechanisms to minimize potential expansion of non-native plants and increase habitat quality and quantity for Greater Sage-Grouse. These treatments also may reduce the probability of severe wildfires which can have undesirable effects on social economic cultural and ecological values. However achieving long-term goals related to fire and fuels may conflict with short-term goals related to survival and viability of threatened and endangered species. Explicit evaluation of spatial and temporal tradeoffs in management of woodlands to reduce wildfire risk maintain sagebrush systems and conserve rare or sensitive species can identify strategies that are either consistent or incompatible with achieving simultaneously these and other objectives.,2010,2013

Improving quantification and prediction of soil carbon storage stability and susceptibility to disturbance,Terrestrial carbon (C) dynamics and the fate of the soil C reservoir recently emerged as one of the largest sources of uncertainty in global C cycle models (Cannadell et al. 2007; Mishra et al. 2013; Scharlemann et al. 2014). Soils contain more C than the atmosphere and aboveground vegetation combined (Ciais et al. 2013) and will undeniably play a major role in determining future climate conditions. However due to the complexities of biogeochemical processes governing soil C storage it is largely unknown whether the role of soil will be to sequester C or instead to contribute further to rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. Defining the stability of this highly relevant C pool and predicting its behavior under future climate scenarios is imperative for understanding and mitigating global climate change. This challenge cannot be overcome without better constraining the primary controls of soil C dynamics across ecosystem types. Improving knowledge of the primary controls of soil C storage requires measurements of distinct soil C pools that are repeatable and comparable across different soil and ecosystem types. However a consistent set of methodologies assessing the fundamental biogeochemical processes governing soil C storage is currently lacking (Jandl et al. 2014). Datasets are often collected using entirely different methodologies or at vastly different resolutions (molecular- to ecosystem-scale) limiting our ability to integrate process-level understanding into terrestrial ecosystem models.

Attempts to use Mo abundances in black shales as an oxybarometer for the atmosphere have rested on the assumption that Mo is mainly contained within sulfides (particularly pyrite) in the upper continental crust and that increased pyrite dissolution rates at higher pO2 results in greater release of Mo. The work to be carried out seeks to test this assumption. ,2016,2019

Measurements of U-Pb ages of titanite of subducted crust can provide a map of how extensively quartzofeldspathic rocks recrystallize at subduction-zone conditions. In this project U-Pb ages and trace-element concentrations of titanite will be measured in situ by laser ablation split-stream ICP mass spectrometry to provide a nappe-scale map of strain in the BrossascoIsasca unit of the diamond-bearing Dora Maira massif. In collaboration with T. Gerya geodynamic models of subduction of quartzofeldspathic rocks at similar P-T conditions will be assessed for concordance with the implications of the titanite measurements. Methods: Detailed field study chemical mapping of major elements trace elements and U-Pb ages using EPMA and LASS. ,2016,2020

Brown, Jr. NEES sites, along with recently developed powerful inversion methods, and the increasing availability of earthquake records, will make it possible for the first time to reconstruct the three-dimensional material profile of local sites and complex basins alike. The problem of site and basin characterization is of great importance to hazard mitigation because knowledge of the in-situ material properties of soil deposits and deeper geological structure is essential for assessing earthquake ground motion; and forecasting this ground motion is an essential first step in designing earthquake resistant facilities and retrofitting existing structures. Thus, a proper knowledge of the geology and soil conditions at local and regional scales is a necessary precursor of the design process. The main objective of the proposed research is to develop the capability for estimating the three- dimensional geological structure and mechanical properties of individual sites and complete basins, and to apply this capability to the nees@UCSB site at the Garner Valley Downhole Array (GVDA) and the entire Garner Valley. This high-resolution estimation will be based on integrating (a) in-situ dynamic excitation using NEES equipment primarily at the University of Texas at Austin (nees@UTexas) developed for advancing the state-of-the-art in in-situ dynamic material property characterization and field testing of soil deposits, (b) earthquake records from new strong-motion and broadband sensor networks, and (c) new inversion methods based on partial differential equations (PDE)-constrained optimization being developed under separate NSF grants. Our reasons for choosing these particular NEES sites are: (1) The equipment at the nees@UTexas site will allow us to apply loads at a wide range of frequencies and loading levels, which will enable us to examine the variability of the soil properties with these parameters. In addition to estimating shear-wave velocity and primary-wave velocity, we propose to include damping in our inversion model as a key soil property to be estimated simultaneously with the two velocities. Despite the critical influence that material attenuation in soils has on dynamic phenomena such as site amplification, damping remains, perhaps, the most poorly known 198 dynamic mechanical soil property. (2) The GVDA is a test site located in a narrow valley in a highly seismic region in southern California, which is ideally suited for monitoring ground motion. The site consists of a set of seven downhole strong-motion instruments. The hundreds of small earthquakes that have been recorded at the site and at other, free surface, locations throughout this valley in the last 15 years make it an invaluable source of data for our regional deep structure inversions. To increase the fidelity of the inverted models, we propose to augment this dataset with data from instruments of the USArray component of EarthScope that we plan to deploy over periods of time that will overlap the periods of active testing. In-situ tests will provide data for characterizing the upper layers at the GVDA site and throughout the valley. Observations from these tests, both downhole and on the free surface, will be used as part of the data set for the inversion of our three-dimensional, high-resolution models, along with earthquake observations.",2006,2012

The common approach for atmospheric correction is to use top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) radiance in the near infrared (NIR) or short-wave infrared (SWIR) to select a ‘standard’ aerosol model, and to then use this model to calculate the TOA atmospheric radiance in the visible (VIS). This approach suffers from limitations that severely restrict the accuracy of water-leaving radiance retrievals especially in coastal regions covered by absorbing aerosols. We propose using radiance observations in the near ultra-violet (NUV) and O2 A-band as well as polarized multiangle radiance measurements in the VIS-NIR-SWIR to improve the efficacy of atmospheric correction for remote sensing of coastal waters. We will mostly utilize currently sponsored flights of the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) onboard an ER-2 (high-altitude) aircraft to obtain the requisite NUV and O2 A-band over the coast of California. We will provide the Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP) onboard the ER-2 at minimal cost to obtain the requisite multiangle VIS-NIR- SWIR polarized radiance. We will expand existing inversion algorithms to include these radiance data, and expand our ocean model to include independent variations for underwater-light scattering and absorption. Validation of atmospheric correction results will be performed by comparing the resulting water-leaving radiance with ship-based measurements from the NASA Plumes and Blooms (PnB) ocean color project. We will compare our ocean color retrievals with those retrieved from coincident satellite observations, and perform extensive sensitivity studies, to evaluate the benefits to atmospheric correction of adding NUV radiance, O2 radiance, and multiangle VIS-NIR-SWIR polarized radiance to the common suite of VIS-NIR-SWIR ocean color observations. The proposed research is the first to date to examine in detail and quantify the anticipated improvement in atmospheric correction when such measurements are included. The 169 need for NUV radiance measurements to achieve this objective has been recognized in the recent formulation of threshold requirements for the NASA Pelagic and Coastal Ecosystem (PACE) mission. The PACE mission also advocates the contemporaneous use of multispectral and multiangle polarized radiance and of O2 A-band radiances to improve atmospheric correction. The results of the proposed research will also benefit other planned NASA missions, such as the Geostationary Coastal and Air Pollution Events (GEO-CAPE) and the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) missions, which add UV (and O2) bands and also require improved atmospheric correction algorithms.

The primary task of the UCSB group is to develop and apply 35S methodology to determine the portion of streamflow derived from the previous winter‚Äôs snowpack. 35S a radioactive isotope with a half-life 87.4 days is produced in the upper atmosphere and enters the hydrologic cycle as dissolved SO42- through precipitation. Because radioactive decay causes the activity of this isotope to decrease below detection limits after about four half-lives (approximately one year) its presence in water indicates that a fraction is derived from recent precipitation. Given the seasonality of precipitation in the Sierra this new method will allow us to quantify the fraction of stream flow derived from the most recent snowmelt.

A large backstepping event has been identified within several Gulf Coast estuaries around 2.6 ka. The continued debate concerning the nature of sea-level change over the last 5 ka, coupled with the lack of century-scale records of climate change, leaves the cause of this event unclear. We propose to use two methods of sea-level and climate reconstructions not previously used in Gulf of Mexico studies to provide tighter constraints on the sea-level and climate history of the northwestern Gulf of Mexico over the last 5 ky. The overall objective of this proposal is to determine the sea-level and climate history along the south Texas coast at a decade-to century-scale resolution over the last 5 ky. Our central hypothesis is that the large backstepping event at 2.6 ka and the formation of higher-than-present beach ridges around Baffin Bay, Texas is not a response to a mid-Holocene highstand along the northwestern Gulf of Mexico but instead occurred in conjunction with severe drought conditions during the middle to late Holocene. In order to test our central hypothesis we propose three specific objectives: (1) create a sea-level curve based on algal mats from the mud flats of upper Baffin Bay, (2) create a detailed record of drought based on isotopes and mineralogy of sediments within a playa lake near Baffin Bay, and (3) date and survey the existing beach ridges found along the shores of Baffin Bay using OSL. In addition to testing our central hypothesis, these new records will provide tighter constraints on the glacio-hydro-isostatic conditions affecting sea levels within the Gulf of Mexico, which will allow a better reconstruction of background rates of sea-level rise throughout the region including Louisiana. The new data will also provide a longer record of century-scale drought than currently exists for the south-central USA. The transformative concepts introduced by this research include the innovative nature of our sea-level reconstruction and testing the possibility that backstepping can be caused not only by elevated rates of sea-level rise but also by climate shifts (e.g., drought conditions).",2010,2012
434p,Alex Simms,7/1/10,6/30/13,91087,Oklahoma State University,Institutes of higher education,AA-5-30220,Constraining the Deglaciation of the Antarctic Peninsula Using OSL Dated Beach Deposits,"Despite many recent studies documenting the extent of the Antarctic Peninsula Ice Sheet (APIS) on the continental shelf, the ice sheet’s thickness remains largely unconstrained. As a result, models of the APIS since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) vary dramatically. One method of estimating the past thickness of ice sheets is the inversion of sea-level data using geophysical techniques. However, along the Antarctic Peninsula few sea-level curves exist and the few curves that do exist are in areas of known tectonic activity or subject to the limitations of a radiocarbon-derived chronology, such as a scarcity of material to date, the uncertainties associated with radiocarbon reservoir affects, and the imprecise relationship of datable material to past sea levels. Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating is a method not subject to the same limitations as radiocarbon dating. As a result it is possible to date features that are not accessible with radiocarbon methods, in particular cobbles within raised beach ridges and boulder pavements. Preliminary OSL ages from beach ridges in the South Shetland Islands of the 188 Antarctic Peninsula show agreement with existing reservoir-corrected radiocarbon-derived sea- level curves. The purpose of this proposal is to acquire OSL dates from whole cobbles within raised beach ridges and boulder pavements from five areas in the Antarctic Peninsula. This research is transformative in the methods for obtaining ages from raised beach deposits for the creation of sea level curves for the region. Our central hypothesis is that systematic differences in sea-level histories can be seen from north to south and east to west across the Antarctic Peninsula. These systematic differences in the sea-level curves will provide important constraints on the thickness and retreat history of the APIS since the LGM. Accurate reconstructions of the ice sheet are particularly important for researchers attempting to disentangle the isostatic adjustment from satellite gravity measurements suggesting mass loss (melting) in the region and predicting the future fate of ice sheets in light of predictions of sea-level rise and global warming.",2010,2013

Process-based modeling provides a non-destructive method to generalize results from site specific field studies to a broad range of scenarios characterized by climate, geomorphology, species type and disturbance regimes within a given region. This proposed work explores these interactions through a series of five questions designed such that the knowledge gained from one step informs the next. Broadly, this work focuses on how streamflow is influenced in a forested, temperate watershed with particular attention to growth/regeneration processes and climate. Specifically, the questions emphasize abiotic, biotic and disturbance themes: 1. Abiotic: How does the timing of water inputs (snowmelt, rain v. snow partitioning) change forest AET/PET? How do soil storage and vegetation characteristics influence this relationship between timing and AET/PET? 2. Biotic: How does a dynamic carbon allocation cycling strategy (fixed ratio, age-based, resource-based) in conifers influence the streamflow response under current climate conditions? And with warmer temperatures? 3. Disturbance: a.Spatial: How does streamflow respond to a change in forest species at variable spatial extents—i.e., entire watershed versus the riparian zone? b.Temporal: How does the trajectory of post-fire recovery of biomass and associated hydrologic response vary with inter-annual climate variability? Does this relationship change under a warmer climate? 4. What climate conditions would push Doug Fir to widespread mortality in the Cascades? We initially approach these questions using Lookout Creek as our study site. Lookout Creek is a 64 sq-km watershed within the McKenzie River basin. Elevation ranges within the watershed frequently include the rain-snow transition zone, thus it is likely to be highly sensitive to climate warming. We address our research questions using RHESSys, a coupled ecohydrological model designed to represent feedbacks between hydrologic and vegetation carbon cycling processes (http://fiesta.bren.ucsb.edu/~rhessys/). This project builds on an existing implementation or RHESSys for Lookout Creek. Vegetation in the basin will be represented by a single canopy layer composed of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), Western Hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), and Red alder (Alnus rubra). Topography (and finest spatial resolution) will be represented with a 30-m digital elevation model (DEM) (available through the HJA data portal http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/data/) and soil depth map (developed by Vache and McDonnell). Historical climate recorded at CS2Met will be used as baseline temperature and precipitation inputs at a daily time scale with PRISM data sets used for spatial scaling of temperature and precipitation. Model performance will be evaluated using daily streamflow records and published estimates of aboveground net primary productivity1,2,3. Additionally, model estimates of canopy height will be checked against a recently completed LIDAR survey and sapflow data of stands of different age in W1 will be used to check calculated transpiration. After we have gained a process-based understanding of key linkages between vegetation change and streamflow at the Lookout Creek scale, we will use the model to explore scenarios at a larger spatial scale, the 2409 sq-km basin of McKenzie River at Vida. The future scenarios will be developed in conjunction with other researchers in the WW2100 project and will include changes in climate (i.e., temperature and precipitation) and shifts in species types and ranges.",2011,2014

Direct measurement of the in-water solar flux divergence, or radiant heating rates, allows variations in solar forcing of stratification, that can be significant, to be accurately quantified (e.g. Ohlmann et al. 1996, Ohlmann et al. 1998, Ohlmann et al. 2000, Hosegood et al. 2008). Solar attenuation depends primarily on upper ocean chlorophyll biomass concentration in open ocean waters. Chlorophyll biomass depends (to first order) on the availability of light and nutrients. When measured together, these data inform on bio-physical feedbacks. This statement of work describes the proposed measurement of surface irradiance and in water solar flux profiles during the Dynamo field experiment. Collecting solar flux profiles allows upper ocean stratification, an important component of upper ocean mixed layer evolution, to be quantified. It is also proposed that water samples be collected for laboratory analysis of chlorophyll biomass and nutrients. These data are 152 necessary to understand why the in-water solar flux divergence varies, and the sampling adds little cost to the project. Upper ocean models work with solar transmission, defined as solar flux at depth relative to the incident value just above the surface. Surface irradiance will thus be sampled with a radiometer mounted on the ship’s mast. The complete data set, to be collected throughout the MJO-evolution cruises, will provide the necessary solar transmission information for accurate quantification of upper-ocean mixing, and will allow the bio-physical influence on stratification/dissipation to be better understood. Profiles of downwelling irradiance and upwelling radiance in 11 spectral bands (~300 to ~700 nm) will be measured using a Satlantic Profiler II Radiometer (www.satlantic.com/profiler). The radiometer is a long (122 cm) slender (9 cm in diameter) hand-deployed freefalling instrument (retrieved using a small winch) that eludes ship motion and shadow.

It is estimated that solar flux profiles will be made to ~40 meters every few hours each day.

Ohlmann,3/15/11,2/28/15,252733,Oregon State University,Institutes of higher education,S1364A-A,DYNAmics of the Madden-Julian Oscillation / DYNAMO Subsurface Fluxes,Solar radiation plays a primary role in the diurnal (mixed layer) stratification process influencing both daytime EKE dissipation and setting up nighttime convection (e.g. Simpson and Dickey 1981 Price et al. 1986 Brainerd and Gregg 1993 Hosegood et al. 2008). Direct measurement of the in-water solar flux divergence or radiant heating rates allows variations in solar forcing of stratification that can be significant to be accurately quantified (e.g. Ohlmann et al. 1996 Ohlmann et al. 1998 Ohlmann et al. 2000 Hosegood et al. 2008). Solar attenuation depends primarily on upper ocean chlorophyll biomass concentration in open ocean waters. Chlorophyll biomass depends (to first order) on the availability of light and nutrients. When measured together these data inform on bio-physical feedbacks. This statement of work describes the proposed measurement of surface irradiance and in water solar flux profiles during the Dynamo field experiment. Collecting solar flux profiles allows upper ocean stratification an important component of upper ocean mixed layer evolution to be quantified. It is also proposed that water samples be collected for laboratory analysis of chlorophyll biomass and nutrients. These data are necessary to understand why the in-water solar flux divergence varies and the sampling adds little cost to the project. Upper ocean models work with solar transmission defined as solar flux at depth relative to the incident value just above the surface. Surface irradiance will thus be sampled with a radiometer mounted on the ships mast. The complete data set to be collected throughout the MJO-evolution cruises will provide the necessary solar transmission information for accurate quantification of upper-ocean mixing and will allow the bio-physical influence on stratification/dissipation to be better understood. Profiles of downwelling irradiance and upwelling radiance in 11 spectral bands (~300 to ~700 nm) will be measured using a Satlantic Profiler II Radiometer (www.satlantic.com/profiler). The radiometer is a long (122 cm) slender (9 cm in diameter) hand-deployed freefalling instrument (retrieved using a small winch) that eludes ship motion and shadow. Coincident measurements of downwelling spectral irradiance and total solar radiation incident at the surface will be made so that solar transmission profiles can be computed. It is estimated that solar flux profiles will be made to ~40 meters every few hours each day. It is possible that profiles in the morning and evening hours when total solar energy is reduced can be made shallower.

Up to now, NASA’s satellite-derived observations of chlorophyll have been the most relevant global data set available for the development, evaluation, and retooling of such models. However, the variable of greatest importance to the global carbon cycle and its impact on climate is the carbon biomass of phytoplankton, not chlorophyll concentration. Consequently, interpreting the discrepancies between simulations and observations is confounded by the fact that the relationship between chlorophyll and carbon biomass is not well understood. A solution to this problem has been found. Through recent advances in ocean color data analysis it is now possible to simultaneously retrieve global distributions of phytoplankton carbon biomass and chlorophyll concentration (Behrenfeld et al., 2004, in press, attached). Based on this new data set, we propose to do the following: (1) Convert the new datasets into a form that would be useful to us and others in the field by constructing global 8-day and monthly datasets of carbon biomass and chlorophyll-to-carbon ratio (Chl:C), as well as additional variables that can be derived from these datasets including phytoplankton growth rate, mixed layer net primary production, and mixed 185 layer loss. (2) Use the resulting global carbon biomass dataset to (a) directly compare observations with model predictions of phytoplankton biomass and growth rate, and to (b) improve our existing ecosystem models and (c) develop a new generation of ''inductive'' models that will be based on the biomass and chlorophyll observations. (3) In collaboration with our colleagues at NOAA’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Lab (GFDL), deploy our ecosystem models in coupled atmosphere-ocean global circulation climate models (AOGCMs). Run concurrently in AOGCMs, independent carbon biomass-based ecosystem models will make it possible to predict future climate change better than has been possible so far. Based on our previous experience with ecosystem models and our analyses of preliminary carbon biomass estimates, we expect that the response of our new models to global warming will be significantly different from our existing models. The prime responsibility of the UCSB group will be to produce and distribute a suite of novel satellite determinations of carbon biomass and growth rates in collaboration with researchers from Princeton University and Oregon State University. Input data for this will be SeaWiFS and MODIS Terra and Aqua missions. We will produce merged global data fields of carbon biomass, carbon to chlorophyll ratio, carbon-based primary production and phytoplankton loss rates and distribute these data sets via the world wide web. This work builds on that of a ReaSON grant to Jim Frew, Stephane Maritorena and David Siegel of UCSB. We will work with researchers from Princeton University and Oregon State University in validating these data sets and will assist in develop predictive models of carbon cycling for predicting future changes in the ocean's carbon cycle.",2006,2009

An outstanding challenge for understanding—and in turn developing more accurate forecasts—of ENSO impacts is the regional and seasonal heterogeneity inherent in the precipitation response to ENSO forcing. We propose here to analyze this spatiotemporally complex response in the context of land-atmosphere (LA) interactions. In pursuing this research we are guided by the following hypotheses: (1) the physical characteristics of the land surface and LA interactions including soil moisture surface energy flux partitioning and boundary layer characteristics account for the regional and seasonal heterogeneity of the rainfall response to ENSO over TSA; (2) the spatial divergence in current generation model simulation of the TSA precipitation response to ENSO can be tied to errors in the simulation of specific land surface processes; and (3) LA interactions modulate how ENSO forcing affects the frequency intensity and duration of sub-daily/daily rainfall which considered together lead to the seasonal-mean responses we associate with ENSO forcing. ,2016,2018

This project will address a topic of scientific and societal importance namely how to evaluate and help prevent negative impacts of drought and human-induced water shortages on vulnerable high-value riparian ecosystems. It will integrate advanced methods in two rapidly emerging fields hyperspectral remote sensing and isotope dendroecology to develop a more holistic understanding of water stress at multiple scales of resolution. The project will compare water stress indicators that vary in their timing strength and rates of change and it will facilitate the evaluation of warning signs and time lags among physiological water stress reduced growth and dieback in individual trees as well as synoptic forest decline evident throughout a river corridor. This project has the potential to influence groundwater management practices throughout California and in water-limited multiple-use basins elsewhere. In partnership with The Nature Conservancy and other project collaborators the investigators will integrate project findings with statewide guidelines for protecting groundwater-dependent riparian ecosystems mandated under California's recently implemented Groundwater Sustainability Management Act. The investigators will interact with groundwater conservation and management efforts in river basins through workshops for managers and stakeholders. They will mentor early-career environmental scientists including women in STEM fields and they will conduct outreach activities for elementary and secondary school students to increase regional environmental awareness in the study region. Riparian forests and woodlands are hotspots of biodiversity and they support key functions and habitats within river corridors but they are particularly sensitive to large changes in water supply. This project will take place in the Santa Clara River in southern California where sustained groundwater pumping for irrigation during a severe drought has had negative impacts and allows for study of riparian woodland response to changing environmental conditions over both short and longer terms. The investigators will assess the signals and thresholds of water stress over the last decade using high-resolution aerial imagery and tree-rings to develop predictors of long-term impairment and collapse. They will capitalize on extensive groundwater well records to link water-table dynamics with changes in plant water status detected at two different scales through the use of basin-wide high-resolution aerial imagery taken seasonally during the drought and annual growth and carbon isotope data from tree rings covering the same period. ,2017,2020

The majority of submerged arctic permafrost (>80%) lies in the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS) where studies in recent years indicate strong and widespread seep bubble ebullition from the vast permafrost deposits underlying this shallow Arctic seas estimated to sequester 1400 x 109 tons carbon primarily in the form of methane. However methane budgets are currently poorly quantified particularly the direct bubble flux; which for such shallow water can be the dominant emission mechanism. Seepage varies significantly on a range of time scales with transient emissions potentially important thus a long-term monitoring capability is critical but currently unavailable. Hence we propose a pilot study to develop and Arctic deploy a mooring to measure critical oceanographic bubble and bubble plume parameters related to seabed dissolved and ebullition emissions. In this study we will integrate instrumentation (custom-developed and off-the shelf previously Arctic- deployed) into an adaptive (smart) long-term Arctic-capable mooring package. We also will map areas of the ESAS for bubble fluxes. Instrumentation will measure: bubble fluxes with active (multibeam scanning sonar). The key acoustic approaches are innovative technological outgrowths of prior NURP-funded research. UCSB pioneered using single-beam sonar to characterize bubble fluxes supported under a previous NURP study and now is adapting state-of-the-art multibeam sonar to quantify bubble flux. Multibeam sonar is critical to reliable flux calibration. Arctic mooring deployment was during a Laptev Sea research cruise during year 1 for a period of half a day. Prior to deployment multibeam sonar and geochemical surveys will characterize site areas. Year 2 will involve multibeam sonar mapping efforts.,2010,2014

Variability in inherent and apparent optical properties as well as biogeochemical properties such as sediment and chlorophyll concentrations is exceptional across the region (Aurin et al. 2010 Aurin & Dierssen 2012). Recent research has shown that the waters are optically complex and other constituents besides phytoplankton play an important role in light absorption and scattering within the estuary. Namely colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and suspended sediment are flushed into the estuary from rivers and these substances serve to absorb considerable amounts of blue light (400-500 nm) and also backscatter light across the visible spectrum. Because of this optical complexity the standard NASA open ocean algorithms for assessing chlorophyll are not intended to be used and are highly inaccurate. Semi-analytical models can be used to retrieve the absorption and backscattering properties of dissolved and suspended materials of coastal environments and Aurin et al. (2010) has already optimized a semi-analytical ocean color algorithm for the dynamic and optically complex LIS estuary. The model provides a means to estimate the contributions of absorption and backscattering coefficients of each component (cdom nap and phytoplankton) and these derived optical properties can then be used to estimate biogeochemical parameters such as total suspended material (TSM) and chlorophyll (Chl). This tuned model however has not yet been regularly applied to imagery from the current ocean color satellites NPP VIIRS and MODIS Aqua and Terra. Because of the challenges in accurately retrieving biogeochemical properties in complex estuaries little work has been done assessing the spatial patterns of biomass and the relationships between temperature and chlorophyll in this region. This work aims to improve the standard satellite image processing to retrieve more accurate measures of phytoplankton biomass. With application of new algorithms we are now poised to assess the long-term relationship between surface temperature and chlorophyll and begin to tackle questions related to how LIS has changed over the last 15 years in response to climate and anthropogenic forcings. ,2016,2017

Determination of the deformational history of the last unstudied fold belt in southern California is essential to understanding the temporal and spatial patterns of deformation in the western Transverse Ranges and to elucidating how this region accommodates plate boundary deformation. In order to successfully achieve this goal we will need to determine the middle Pleistocene-Holocene chronology of deformed strata in the CFB. Terrestrial strata in the CFB are currently correlated with the Saugus Formation deformed at South Mountain and regions to the north and west. The upper age limit of Pleistocene strata in this part of the western Transverse Ranges is unknown. Because the age of these deposits is beyond the reliable range of most Quaternary chronometers we propose to date these deposits using U-series dating of pedogenic carbonates of which are abundant within the Saugus Formation in the CFB and elsewhere.,2007,2012
461p,Jamison Steidl,2/1/07,1/31/12,135000,University of Southern California,Institutes of higher education,120044,SCEC3 Participation: SCEC Borehole Instrumentation Program,"The SCEC borehole program continues to be a collaborative effort between SCEC and other agencies to maintain the existing network of borehole stations in California and to facilitate the integration of this data into CISN and the SCEC data center. The borehole program is highly leveraged, taking advantage of the resources of other programs and agencies that are active in monitoring southern California earthquake activity. This data is made available online to the public and research community. The SCEC borehole data gathering effort is contributing to the overall scientific goals of the SCEC collaboratory. For example, the borehole data available online at the SCEDC and at IRIS from the SCEC/PBO stations in the Anza region are providing a unique new high-resolution data set for analysis of earthquake source parameters (Priority A4), as well as providing observations of non-volcanic tremor induced events in the region following large regional and very large global earthquakes. In addition, the borehole instrumentation is critical to improving our understanding of nonlinear effects and to developing methodologies to include these effects into ground motion simulations (Priority B4, B5). As has been the case for many years, joint monitoring efforts continue between SCEC and the US Geological Survey and Caltech through ANSS, NSMP, and CISN, and the California Geological Survey to maintain the existing network of borehole stations. Other collaborators include the NSF funded NEES and HPWREN programs, as well as a newly funded NSF project to look at the San Jacinto Fault zone, including the installation of additional borehole sensors. In 2011, SCEC borehole stations will continue to be upgraded along with the CISN network stations in southern California. This includes migration to new datalogger technology and the upgrade of surface sensors. As the SCEC borehole stations come up on the schedule for network wide upgrades, we will continue to work with the SCSN field technicians during the upgrade process. The SCEC borehole program will also continue the collaboration with the NEES program (Priority B6) through processing and data dissemination of the SCEC borehole data; the SCEC/EarthScope Plate Boundary Observatory borehole strainmeter program that includes both weak- and strong-motion seismic monitoring in the Anza region; and the strong-motion borehole sensors being installed as part of a new NSF funded study of the San Jacinto fault zone.",2007,2012

Using methods from robust control theory [Dullerus and Paganini 2005] this project develops bounds on source characteristics by defining and solving a series of optimization problems which maximize the information extracted from seismic inversions and determine which features are well-constrained by the data. Quantifying uncertainty in kinematic inversions is necessary in order to interpret the variability and features seen in source models. While kinematic inversions provide direct images of the seismic source the robust features of these images are not well known. A thorough treatment of the consequences of uncertain models and statistical correlations in seismic inversions is necessary in order to characterize the inherent variability of the seismic process. This work fits SCEC3 objectives A4 A10 and B1. Objective A4 calls for statistical analysis and mapping of source parameters with an emphasis on their relation to known faults. Our project focuses on better understanding the statistical correlations between possible models of slip (and therefore stress change) on the Parkfield segment of the San Andreas fault. Also Objective A10 describes the development of statistical descriptions of heterogeneities over multiple earthquake cycles. Indeed the Parkfield segment is ideal for studying the earthquake cycle as data from multiple moderately sized earthquakes have been recorded there. It is necessary to know the error in inversion methods in order to determine to what extent the Parkfield earthquake are ‚Äúcharacteristic‚Äù. Finally Objective B1 asks for the development of kinematic rupture scenarios consistent with observations. Our project seeks to better describe this large solution space that is consistent with observations (as opposed to selecting only a few arbitrary models from this space).,2007,2012

464p,Ralph Archuleta,2/1/07,1/31/12,8000,University of Southern California,Institutes of higher education,120044,A Collaborative Project: Rupture Dynamics Validation of the Numerical Simulation Method,In 2011 we plan to visit heterogeneous initial stress conditions on a planar vertical fault TPV18. With classic benchmark TPV5 we have already addressed light stress heterogeneity on a vertical strike-slip fault but it was so light as to be almost homogeneous. Instead we wish to address the true variability that is envisioned for most faults by earthquake geologists and seismologists. Many members of our SCEC code community participated in a PGE/SCEC workshop in May 2010 where different approaches to assigning heterogeneous initial stress conditions were presented and discussed. Subsequently a hybrid method has been developed and implemented to assign heterogeneous initial conditions in the limited-PI PGE/SCEC dipping-fault 100-runs project. It is now time that we investigate this heterogeneity topic as an open group exercise. TPV18 is proposed to be an implementation of the a hybrid method but on a vertical strike-slip fault. It is also hoped that TPV18 will help address some interesting issues that have arisen in the 100-runs project whereby the near-surface results produced by the three assigned codes although matching well at some of the synthetic ground motion stations do not match as perfectly as we had originally hoped for the dipping-fault scenario. By having our entire code group tackle a related benchmark on a vertical fault we hope that we can solve this problem and move forward with future heterogeneous initial conditions research and implementation. UCSB will work on only this problem within the Collaborative Project.,2007,2012
465p,Ralph Archuleta,2/1/07,1/31/12,24000,University of Southern California,Institutes of higher education,120044,Rupture Dynamics on Sulti-Segment Faults,The basic goals of this research are as following: 1) Calculate multiple earthquake scenarios on a multi-segment fault to understand how the absolute initial stress conditions influence the rupture behavior and the resulting ground motion. Assigning absolute stress values in the dynamic rupture calculations is controversial. For example with constant static and dynamic coefficients of friction one would expect the stress drop to increase with depth if œÉN increases with depth ‚Äîas would be expected because of the lithostatic overburden. However estimates of stress drop show no clear evidence of increasing with depth. We can have nearly constant shear stress as well as stress drop out of uniform normal stress œÉN. However with increasing normal stress œÉN along depth we tend to get depth dependent stress drops (Dalguer and Mai 2010). Previous research (Shearer et al 2006 Allmann and Shearer 2007 Hardebeck 2009) shows that the median stress drop tends to be depth independent for depths as much as 15 km. An approach taken by Aagaard and Heaton (2001) reconciles the depth dependent normal stress and depth independent stress drop by making the friction coefficient depth dependent. Rice (1992) proposed making the effective normal stress constant by allowing the pore pressure to increase linearly with depth. It is likely that the configuration of the initial stress conditions has a pronounced effect on allowing the jump from one fault to another. Both a depth dependent and a depth independent initial stress will be considered. Of course in both cases the stress will be overprinted stress heterogeneity (LavalleÃÅe et al 2006). 2) Investigate the geometrical conditions (degree of overlapping and step over between adjacent segments) under which a cascading earthquake can occur. Whether an earthquake will be limited to a single fault or will jump over physical boundaries between faults makes a significant difference in the seismic moment and ground motion. To give a more reliable estimate of seismic hazard in areas with multi-segmented faults we will focus on two parameters: separation distance and overlapping distance between the adjacent fault segments. We will systematically alter these two parameters to quantify the conditions when a rupture jumps from one segment to another. 3) Study the velocity strengthening layer its depth and its implementation. In rupture dynamics as well as rock physics studies it is well known that the friction on the fault plane is slip rate dependent (e.g. Dieterich 1979). Based on laboratory experiments (Blanpied et al. 1991) the upper 3-4 km of the crust would show velocity strengthening. In this zone the friction increases with the slip rate and thus would inhibit slip (Scholz 1998). Earthquakes such as Morgan Hill Loma Prieta Tottori Parkfield are events with M > 6 but with no obvious co- seismic slip at the surface. There are different ways to mimic the friction in the velocity strengthening zone when using a slip weakening friction law. For example one can make the critical distance dc infinite in the zone (e.g. Day and Ely 2002) increase dynamic friction 1coefficient to static coefficient level (e.g. Barall et al 2010) or make the dynamic friction coefficient velocity dependent (e.g. Aagaard et al 2004). We will test each of these implementations.,2007,2012

We will use the BVDA data and the data from the SCEC deployment that coincide with events recorded at BVDA. In doing this we will determine Q(f). We will also try to determine site amplification factors for the SCEC portable stations; we will back out the amplification using BVDA data or by using representative shallow velocity structure measured in Imperial Valley. We will compare stress drops of the aftershocks with those on the San Jacinto to see i) if the same spatial distribution exists as found by Shearer et al. (2006) and ii) if stress drops for 4.0 < M < 5.5 have the same median and variation found for events in other magnitude ranges. We will use the spatial variation of the stress on the northern end (Paso Superior fault) as a proxy for the slip in a finite fault simulation (Schmedes et al. 2010). Our intent is to use an empirical Green‚Äôs function approach (Archuleta et al. 2003) to simulate the mainshock ground motion at BVDA. Simulations of the mainshock by Graves and Aagaard (2010) show that the radiated waves are strongly refracted by the velocity structure causing focusing in the region near BVDA as opposed to the expected strong directivity along strike. This may explain why the spectrum of the El Mayor mainshock at BVDA is amplified and its corner frequency much higher than expected.,2007,2012

Results from PBRs (ages and fragilities) will directly test seismicity models ground motion prediction equations and hazard estimates associated with the 2008 USGS National Seismic Hazard Maps (NSHM) and Cybershake. Detailed work will be conducted in one catchment at each site. Morphometric characteristics of each catchment (e.g. area slope hypsometry channel steepness) will be analyzed using a digital elevation model (DEM) constructed using ground-based LiDAR and differential-GPS survey data (with collaborator B. Bookhagen). 10Be stream sediment samples will allow us to estimate the average denudation rate in each basin where PBRs were exhumed. Saprolite will be sampled near a PBR in each catchment to address the site-specific denudation rate. Detailed profiles will be collected from a total of 5 additional PBRs (3 rocks from Granite Pediment and 2 additional rocks from Lovejoy Buttes) in order to address the timing of PBR exhumation (with collaborator G. Balco). At Granite Pediment a 10Be sample from a slowly eroding bedrock exposure on the pediment surface will be used to estimate the grain-by-grain rock erosion rate. Our goal is to compile new and existing shape models tipping test 10Be data and VML limiting ages for the Mojave Desert PBRs. We will systematically compare results from (1) 2-D alpha and 3-D overturning probability estimates from shape models with quasi-static toppling accelerations and alpha calculations from force-inclination (tipping) tests and (2) model 10Be exposure ages with minimum VML ages.,2007,2012

Specific tasks are: § Re-examination of SKS data: While our surface wave model shows strong anisotropy close to the major faults, there is no such reports on SKS data so far. We have examined SKS data in Southern California in 2008 but we need to extend the region toward north in order to conclusively determine the change in anisotropic pattern. § Re-examination of long-period surface wave data: It seems almost certain that deeper anisotropic layer is required to explain the two types of data simultaneously. However, our current Rayleigh-wave data do not contain long period (> 100 sec) information and thus it would be hard to examine internal consistency between SKS data and Rayleigh wave data. We will re-examine long-period (>100 sec) surface wave data and expand the frequency range of the data set. § Develop finite-frequency approach for SKS splitting data and perform joint inversion: As both SKS data and surface wave data are long period and differ in their 221 lateral wavelengths, it is important to take into account finite-frequency effects. We intend to reformulate both approaches and invert the data. § Anisotropy and S velocities in the SCEC_CLM and SCEC_CVM: Our data on S velocities and anisotropy will be input to the California Lithosphere model. In addition we will include data from the Sierra Nevada Earthscope Project (SNEP), which is adding significantly to the SKS determinations.

The new systems use commercial grade cellular VPN routers or other available Internet based telemetry that allows for continuous transmission of data back to the USGS/Caltech component of CISN. Ongoing projects using PBIC equipment include: real-time deployment of the PBIC stations along the Elsinore fault zone; array deployment of 10 RefTek stations at Pinon Flat to monitor potential tremor activity in the region; and use of the broadband CMG-40T sensors at stations in the Anza regional network. There are no upcoming project on the schedule for 2011 although there have been a couple of inquiries as to instrument availability. What typically happens is projects will develop throughout the course of the year that utilize the PBIC equipment, and we will continue to support these projects as instruments are requested. Maintaining a pool of working stations for rapid deployment in the event of a significant earthquake in California remains the first priority of the PBIC. In addition to support of field deployments, the PBIC project will continue to maintain the existing pool of older instruments including the long-term loan equipment from the IRIS PASSCAL instrument center and newly acquired RefTek 72A series instruments from the DOE. Heavy involvement of undergraduates is an important part of the PBIC operations as these student laboratory assistants perform the majority of the routine maintenance work under the supervision of the PI and/or engineering staff at the Earth Research Institute.

474p,Ralph Archuleta,2/1/08,1/31/12,120000,University of Southern California,Institutes of higher education,120044,SCEC3: Prediction of Broadband Time Histories,We will continue to improve this new method for predicting broadband ground motion. We propose 4 main tasks: 1) Use dynamic modeling to get a better understanding of the spatial interdependency between kinematic parameters and selecting parameters that are most suitable for implementation in a kinematic rupture model. In short we need to select the best possible correlated parameters as input to the kinematic models. 2) Use a different slip rate function than the one proposed in Liu et al. (2006). Looking at the slip rate functions in the more than 250 dynamic models that we have computed thus far we find that the slip rate model of Liu et al. (2006) has a different convexity following the peak slip rate than that in Liu et al. (2006). 3) Implement the new results in the kinematic rupture model generator and repeat the validations. The validations will include both Northridge and Loma Prieta. 4) Implement new rupture model generator in broadband simulation platform. We will work on refinement of our rupture model generator based on insights gained from dynamic modeling (Schmedes et al. 2008b). Our current analysis suggests that average rupture velocity and slip show a wide range of positive and negative correlations. Furthermore slip and local rupture velocity do not seem to be a good parameter pair to use because there is basically no correlation between the two when the rupture attains its larger speeds. This observation is illustrated in Figure 3 (top). We show the joint probability distribution for rupture velocity/shear wave velocity and slip amplitude/ average slip for one of the dynashake shakeout ruptures computed by Steve Day and Luis Dalguer. Once the rupture gained a certain speed there is no dependency of the rupture speed with the slip amplitude. We also observe this in the about 250 dynamic rupture models we have computed so far. Hence a different parameterization of the kinematic model for example using correlated peak slip rate and rupture velocity is necessary.,2008,2012
475p,Ralph Archuleta,2/1/08,1/31/12,43000,University of Southern California,Institutes of higher education,120044,SCEC3: Rupture Nucleation and the Evolution of dc,This is a continuation of prior research goals as follows: 1) to complete our work on the effect of heterogeneities on nucleation and 2) to focus on dynamic ruptures where the effect of heterogeneous strength and stress fields are analyzed in terms of the rupture velocity and slip rate functions that they produce. The first objective will allow us to examine how fracture energy scales as the rupture initially grows. At some point the relevant length scales are likely to come from the correlation lengths found in the strength/stress fields. Exactly how the heterogeneity affects the friction law seems to follow the predictions of Campillo et al. (2001) but this still has be examined further. Once a rupture is propagating the correlation lengths of the strength/stress fields looks to be of primary importance. We have already shown that if the fields are strongly correlated the rupture velocity can range from sub- to super-shear. Whereas if the fields are weakly correlated the rupture velocity is generally limited to sub-shear. The dynamics of the rupture from initiation through completion forms the basis for earthquake physics. Phenomena from earthquake scaling spontaneous triggering crack behavior versus pulse-like to ground motion prediction depend fundamentally on what happens during the spontaneous propagation of a frictional shear fracture. It is only recently that we have had the tools and the computational power to explore the fundamentals of the earthquake process. However we cannot model the stress heterogeneity on all scales. Thus we must determine an ‚Äúeffective‚Äù friction law that accounts for the stress heterogeneity at scales smaller than what can be modeled. Using this effective friction we will explore its consequences on the dynamics of a propagating rupture.,2008,2012

In due course additional site response modules from other SCEC investigators such as Assimaki will be added to the platform but they will not be usable with the broadband simulation methods until this separation is made. Task 5. Verification of methods for measuring goodness of fit for validation of simulations on the Broadband Platform Validation of strong motion simulation procedures against strong motion recordings requires measures of goodness of fit. The purpose of this task is to install and test a comprehensive suite of measures of goodness of fit on the platform to allow the user of the platform to select and use implement their preferred measures in the course of validation exercises. SDSU will take the lead (in a separate contract) in developing these modules for the Platform and UCSB and URS will review and test the modules.,2009,2012

The Saugus is variably deformed across numerous active faults in Los Angeles and Ventura Counties and its inferred age is commonly used to quantify fault slip rates. Yet because the formation is diachronous across the region and few absolute ages exist fault slip rates on many of the largest faults in Southern California are poorly constrained. Until recently the age of Saugus strata (0.2- 2 Ma) lay outside the range of applicability of existing Quaternary geochronological techniques. However with the advent of recent advances in cosmogenic nuclide burial dating (36Cl/10Be isochron dating) which is capable of precisely dating (uncertainty <5-10%) strata of this age a new opportunity exists to determine the age of these tectonically significant strata. The resulting chronology of the Saugus Formation will directly contribute to and reduce uncertainties in earthquake hazards assessments associated with the USGS Earthquake Hazard Program UCERF3 and the proposed SCEC Ventura Special Fault Study Area. The primary focus of this research is to resolve the two-fold uncertainty in the existing fault slip rate (5.9 mm/a and 12.5 mm/a) of the Oak Ridge fault (ORF) which extends for ~40 km through urbanized Ventura County. Rates are based on the inferred age of the Saugus Formation with the 2-fold range in the rate reflecting the uncertainty in the upper age of Saugus strata (200-500 ka). Funds from this grant will be used to conduct fieldwork including geologic mapping and identification of propitious sites for cosmogenic sampling of the top and the bottom of the Saugus Formation. Fieldwork will focus along a North-South transect from the across the Oak Ridge hangingwall north of Moorpark California where a thick section of Saugus strata are preserved in the Happy Campy syncline.,2012,2015

The PBIC is currently managed at the Earth Research Institute (ERI) by Dr. Jamison Steidl with support from undergraduate student laboratory assistants from the department of geological sciences and electrical and computer engineering. The ability for SCEC to respond rapidly to a major southern California earthquake with the deployment of seismographs in the near-source region was a catalyst for the creation of the PBIC and is a critical asset of SCEC earthquake research community. This has been highlighted recently by the successful deployment of PBIC equipment in the 2010 El Mayor–Cucapah earthquake as well as the 2008 shakeout experiments along the southern San Andreas. Other PBIC successful RAMP deployments occurred in conjunction with the 2004 Parkfield and 2003 San Simeon earthquakes, as well as the four major earthquake sequences in the previous decade (1992 M6.1 Joshua Tree and M7.3 Landers, 1994 M6.7 Northridge, and 1999 M7.1 Hector Mine). The ability to conduct individual PI driven research experiments in between these major earthquake sequences using PBIC equipment is another very important asset. One of the main goals of the PBIC is to facilitate research in the earthquake community by providing readily accessible seismic monitoring stations for deployment in the southern California region. This year, as we embark on SCEC4, the Portable Instrument Center is starting to upgrade the data acquisition technology to current real-time systems, capable of integrating directly with the SCSN operations. Over the course of SCEC3, using its two newer real-time stations, the PBIC has 202 demonstrated the capability to deploy and integrate it’s stations into the regional network, providing high-quality observations that are being used for earthquake locations and shake map applications. These stations have proven to be dependable and require very little maintenance. The previous generation of SCEC portable equipment is now coming up on two decades of operations. This older equipment is no longer completely reliable or cost-effective to deploy, as it requires regular site visits and post-processing efforts. Data recovery is about 75% in the winter months and as low as 50% in the summer months due to the age of the equipment, and failure of the older SCSI hard drives in the warmer summer temperatures. This year equipment will be added to provide a third modern real-time station to be used by the SCEC community, as well as maintenance and operations of the other two currently deployed stations.",2012,2015

Develop better models of friction in fault gouge through reformulation of the STZ theory in terms of concepts more appropriate for strictly granular systems (perfectly hard spheres) in which there is no intrinsic energy scale to extract the broad spectrum of transition rates and trapping volumes and to capture inherent variability arising from the broad range of grain sizes in fault gouge. Develop a multi-scale approach to the dynamic rupture problem through the resolution of dynamics that arise from these constitutive laws and the material properties of the fault gouge to obtain predictive results for dissipation and fracture from laboratory to tectonic scales. Assess the heat flow paradox through the analysis of energy balance and thermal heating during large earthquakes based on general thermodynamic principles as well as specific information regarding the materials and failure mechanisms that occur in faults.

Our focus is on three experimental paradigms that occur in shear flow--- compactivity comminution and thermally induced changes in material properties. Each of these is of interest to the SCEC Fault and Rock Mechanics community and each has become accessible theoretically based on advances in STZ theory made in the last year. Our goal is to provide a first- principles quantitative interpretation of the great wealth of experimental data on fault gouge that to date has been treated phenomenologically. The advantage of a physics-based approach is that it enables extrapolation from the lab to the field. In the first project we will connect our theory of granular hard-sphere systems [Lieou and Langer 2012] to the phenomenon of auto-acoustic compaction-- the suppression of shear dilatancy by means of internal acoustic vibration‚Äîin steady shear flows which was recently observed in laboratory experiments [Elst Brodsky Bas and Johnson 2012]. We will examine how the STZ compactivity (which characterizes local volume fluctuations) is influenced by the shear rate and account for the apparent reduction in porosity due to acoustic vibrations generated at intermediate shear velocities. In the second project we will examine frictional weakening mechanisms associated with grain breakage. This involves augmentation of the original STZ theory to incorporate the effects of broad distributions of particle sizes and STZ transition barriers as was done recently to characterize aspects of the glass transition [Langer 2012] as well as physical mechanisms for granular fracture and wear [Mair and Abe 2011]. In geophysical applications the distribution of particle sizes may be responsible for frequency dependent response and variability in friction characteristics [Marone and Scholz 1989]. Grain breakage is expected to lead to frictional weakening and provides a significant pathway for energy dissipation that will help account for the lack of thermal heating during earthquakes. In the third project we will build on our recent work involving extensions of STZ theory that include thermally varying material properties [Elbanna and Carlson 2012]. The next phase will focus on shear banding as an additional weakening mechanism in order to model more realistically the shearing response of gouge layers at high strain rates. We will compare our results with laboratory experiments of Sone and Shimamoto [2009] that exhibit strain localization and rapid velocity weakening.,2012,2015

The primary focus is to estimate the relative contribution of on and off-fault dissipation mechanism to the total energy budget. We will start by investigating the conditions under which a steady slip pulse can propagate on a velocity- weakening friction interface embedded in an elasto-plastic bulk. Steady propagation will allow us to examine the relationship between the width of the plastically deforming zone surrounding the fault and the constant width of the slip pulse. Because steady propagation does not emit radiated energy accurate bounds can be placed in this case on the energy dissipated in the inelastic and frictional processes. Steady propagation will also allow us to investigate in a more systematic way the effect of perturbations in the material properties material response and prestress on the rupture dynamics including variability in rupture speed maximum slip rate and ultimately rupture arrest. We will also address several seismologically-relevant questions. For example we will be examine the effect of off-fault plasticity on seismic observables like rupture speed acceleration to limiting speed in sub-shear ruptures transition to super shear and slip rate functions (in terms of the maximum and the average values of slip rates). Moreover we will also be able to assess the impact of off-fault dissipation on the high frequency content of ground motion. This is relevant for developing physically-based models for ground motion prediction. The project will accomplish the following tasks: a. Quantify the magnitude of on- and off-fault dissipation and their relative contribution to the earthquake energy budget for different friction laws (rate and state law/slip weakening law). b. Constrain the absolute levels of prestress consistent with the different modes of ruptures (cracks vs pulses) with and without the presence of off-fault dissipation mechanisms. c. Investigate the effect of off-fault dissipation on high frequency ground motion,2012,2015

Dynamic rupture model for Elmore Ranch earthquake. Although the Elmore Ranch Fault (ERF) earthquake is relatively simple (most researchers have treated it as a point source) we want to construct a more comprehensive stress model for the ERF earthquake. We want to construct the initial stress on the ERF fault first using existing methods (e.g. Hauksson 1994) considering its local tectonic context and fault geometry and also taking into account the aftershock sequence of the ERF earthquake during the 12 hours preceding the Superstition Hills Fault (SHF) earthquake. 2. Evaluate the stress perturbation on the SHF due to the Elmore Ranch earthquake Based on the results from Step 1 as well as the location and focal information of the aftershock sequence of the ERF earthquake we will evaluate the stress perturbation on the main SHF. We will account for the fault geometry with great care to insure the relative accuracy of the Coulomb stress change estimates. It is obvious that the MW 6.2 ERF earthquake will have a major influence on the SHF nucleation. 3. Dynamic rupture model for Superstition Hills earthquake. We are going to combine the results from first two steps as outlined and previous research to constrain our stress model. We will take into account the heterogeneous velocity structure such as variable basement depth material property contrast across the fault as well as the non-planar feature of the fault (gradual fault strike changes segment stepover). We wish to integrate as much previous research as possible to construct our rupture dynamics model. We want to construct an initial stress field that could produce the key rupture patterns obtained from the observations. The relocated aftershock dataset gives us a chance to look at the possibility of stress transfer and triggering. The strong motion waveforms and the surface rupture measurements place strong constraints on the stress conditions in the upper kilometers which have almost no aftershocks in the double difference catalog. In particular we will analyze the stress conditions for the dynamic rupture model paying specific attention to the emergent nucleation and the partitioning of the seismic radiation into and high- and low-frequency energy.,2012,2015

Several kinematic and dynamic rupture scenarios (Graves et al. 2008; Olsen et al. 2009) had been created to artificially break a 305 km long segment of the San Andreas fault from Bombay Beach on the Salton Sea to Lake Hughes 20 km northwest of Palmdale. Multiple groups have preformed the deterministic ground motion modeling for low frequencies (<1Hz) using SCEC CVM4 velocity structure and some of results were in good agreement (Bielak et al. 2010). Graves et al. (2008) also generated the broadband (0‚Äì10 Hz) ground motion simulations which combines a 3D deterministic approach at low frequencies (<1 Hz) with a semi-stochastic approach at high frequencies (>1 Hz). Currently this unique dataset has been used yearly for the ShakeOut earthquake drill which had 8.6 million participants this year. Here we propose to use it as a benchmark to test algorithms of quick finite fault inversion and ground motion prediction. We propose to address the following questions: 1) How quick can we determine the focal mechanism seismic moment of this scenario earthquake using the new MDC approach? 2) How quick can a finite fault source model based on current algorithm be available? 3) What is the spatial-temporal resolution using current strong motion and high rate GPS stations? 4) Can we improve the results with additional stations? If so where are their locations? Note that the previous simulations produced the waveforms at dense surface grids allowing us to address this subject without additional expensive forward calculations. 5) How well will the predicted strong ground motion be? Considering the limited waveform information used to constrain the realtime finite fault the quick solution might not be very precise. Then what is the quality of the predicted ground motion parameters such as PGV and intensity? In the end as suggested by committee efforts will focus on internally operating this realtime system in UCSB and USGS Pasadena office. We also attempt to incorporate the USGS realtime GPS data flow into the system.,2013,2015
493p,Ralph Archuleta,2/1/13,1/31/15,25000,University of Southern California,Institutes of higher education,SCEC4 ,Participation Project H: Incorporating Roughness and Supershear in UCSB Broadband Modeling,A puzzling observation of recorded borehole ground motion at very close hypocentral distances from faults reveal a great deal of incoherency in high frequency (HF) seismograms from direct body waves. Because of their arrivals and the closeness of the recording station to the fault one can deduce that the level of scattering of these waves is not that meaningful. Scattering increases in a diffusive way with distance and travel time (Zeng et al. 1990) making it difficult for CODA to show up at such short distances. Therefore a plausible assumption is that there must be complexity at the rupture fronts of earthquakes for very small scales (Gusev 2012). With these important observations it is necessary to study in detail the rupture front complexity and to answer the question: Is the rupture front continuous and smooth across the fault? If we find that rupture front is not smooth or continuous across the fault then a natural follow up question would be how will this complexity at smaller scales affect ground motion intensity measures (GMI‚Äôs) such as PGA PGV and Arias Intensity? If we find that the rupture front is not continuous or smooth then the effect of the irregularity in the rupture front must be included into current kinematic ground motion simulation techniques such as Schmedes et al. (SAL 2010).,2013,2015

In the current UCSB BB method the Greens functions are critical to a realistic estimate of the ground motion because they are used for both the high- and low-frequency wave propagation. We will modify the specified velocity structure for propagating high frequencies (f ≥ ~1.0 Hz). The low-frequency computation will remain the same. For the high frequencies we will eliminate the near-surface velocity structure. A constant-velocity anelastic medium will be used for depths to the deepest part of the fault. The shear wave velocity will be selected such that it has almost the same travel time as for the original structure. The Greens functions will be adjusted in time so that the S waves align. After modifying the UCSB BB method we will verify the modifications by recomputing all the ground motions in the validation exercise of June 2013 and will continue with larger broadband platform research. ,2014,2015

In particular we will focus on reproducing the ground motions from the 1988 Saquenay M 5.8 earthquake the 2011 Mineral Virginia M 5.6 earthquake and the 2005 Riviere du Loup M 4.9 earthquake. 1. We will investigate the likelihood that stress drop in the eastern US is depth dependent. 2. We know that the 1-D Greens functions fail to produce the temporal signature found in the data. To correct this we will be adding scattering coda to the time histories by convolving scattering functions with the Greens functions for a 1-D velocity structure. Jin et al. (1994) and Mayeda and Walters (1996) show that at different frequency bands the coda energy envelopes exhibit different durations for different tectonic regions. Thus we first have to determine for the scattering parameters for the eastern US before convolving with the Greens functions. ,2015,2015

The Transverse Ranges is southern California’s version of a convergent margin and recent work between Ventura and Carpinteria has demonstrated that the Ventura Avenue Anticline (VAA) and associated Pitas Point – Ventura thrust have produced large uplift events. The amount of inferred uplift, on the order of 7-8 m per event, likely results in the production of a sizable tsunami along the Santa Barbara – Ventura County coastline, although until recently no one has looked for tsunami deposits in this region. Prior work in Carpinteria Salt Marsh has identified a potential tsunami layer and a stratigraphy suggesting the presence of subsidence events within the marsh. In this coming year, we propose two primary tasks to test whether a coseismic subsidence signal is present and provide more support for a tsunami origin for the deposits. First, we will need to create a metric within Carpinteria Salt Marsh to test for sudden subsidence events. This will be done by conducting a survey of modern microfossils (foraminifera and diatoms) in order to establish transfer functions for high-resolution sea-level index points to be used to quantify subsidence. Second, we propose to duplicate this study in nearby Goleta Slough to determine if a similar record of proposed tsunami deposits is present.",2012,2016

This model will include the sedimentary section offshore south central California and the uppermost part of the metamorphic basement rock. This model will be provided to the SCEC Community Velocity Model probably to Harvard as time depth charts at wells. For areas of Santa Barbara Channel where seismic stratigraphic interpretation is completed the 3D velocity model will also be provided as 3D grids of stratigraphic horizons in both time and depth.

499p,Alexander Simms Ralph Archuleta,2/1/12,1/31/17,56700,University of Southern California,Institutes of higher education,Y86552-L,SCEC4 Participation Project L: Collaborative Research: Documentation of Tsunami Deposits in the Carpinteria and Goleta Slough Estuaries: A signal of Great Earthquakes on the Pitas Point Thrust,Large earthquakes and their associated tsunamis including recent earthquakes and tsunamis in Sumatra (2004) and Japan (2011) have brought into sharp focus the hazards associated with convergent margins. The Transverse Ranges is southern Californias version of a convergent margin and recent work between Ventura and Carpinteria has demonstrated that the Ventura Avenue Anticline (VAA) and associated Pitas Point  Ventura thrust have produced large uplift events. The amount of inferred uplift on the order of 7-8 m per event likely results in the production of a sizable tsunami along the Santa Barbara  Ventura County coastline although until recently no one has looked for tsunami deposits in this region. Prior work in Carpinteria Salt Marsh has identified a potential tsunami layer and a stratigraphy suggesting the presence of subsidence events within the marsh. In this coming year we propose two primary tasks to test whether a coseismic subsidence signal is present and provide more support for a tsunami origin for the deposits. First we will need to create a metric within Carpinteria Salt Marsh to test for sudden subsidence events. This will be done by conducting a survey of modern microfossils (foraminifera and diatoms) in order to establish transfer functions for high-resolution sea-level index points to be used to quantify subsidence. Second we propose to duplicate this study in nearby Goleta Slough to determine if a similar record of proposed tsunami deposits is present. ,2012,2017

However the fault motion and geometry used as a source for these model predictions has been called into question (Nicholson et al. 2015). To date evidence for such large tsunamis is lacking. However the only viable archive along this coastline that has been examined is Carpinteria Slough which appears to be undergoing large environmental shifts at the same time as the purported large earthquakes potentially masking any potential tsunami deposits within the slough (Reynolds et al. 2015). Most of the coastline of the Santa Barbara Channel is marked by cliffs or sandy beaches with very few marshes like Carpinteria Slough to preserve evidence for tsunami inundation. However recent work along other coastlines known to have experienced large tsunamis (>6 m) like those predicted to have struck the Santa Barbara Channel coast have shown that sandy beach ridges also provide a record of past tsunami inundation and erosion (Meyers et al. 1996; Gouramanis et al. 2015; Simms et al. 2015). The purpose of this project is to determine if such erosional surfaces can be found in Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) profiles along the coastal beach plain of Ventura and Oxnard California. Their presence/absence provides a test for tsunamis hypothesized to have been created by earthquakes events along the PPT-VAA. ,2012,2017
501p,Chen Ji Ralph Archuleta,2/1/12,1/31/17,30000,University of Southern California,Institutes of higher education,Y86552-R,SCEC4 Participation Project R: Characterization of induced micro-seismicity associated with one hydraulic fracturing experiment near the San Andreas Fault Central California,With an agreement between UCSB and Venoco we are able to access micro-seismic observations of one multi-stage hydraulic experiment. The experiment was conducted on a site only 8 km away from the San Andreas fault in Central California. This will allow the following three research activities: 1) Improve the location and detecting limitation of microseismic events using a linear array of receivers. All research activities rely on precise event locations. Due to cylinder symmetry we cannot locate earthquakes using only the travel-time information collected by such a sub-vertical array; the polarity information must be used. Most uncertainties in locations result from the relatively large uncertainties in polarization analysis. We expect that the multiple path effects of a cluster of events shall be similar the relative locations of these events shall be much better. The relocate earthquake catalog will be used to track the migration of micro-seismic events during the post-stages periods. 2) Focal mechanisms. A single-azimuth data set (as in single well monitoring) in the far field cannot resolve the dipole perpendicular to the plane of stations and the hypocenter [Vavrycuk 2007]. However we could exclude the unresolvable moment tensor (MT) component in a suitable coordinate system and determine the class of MTs constrained by the data [Jechumtalova and Eisner 2008]. As the initial attempt we will specially focus on the events with single-phase. 3) Stress drop of seismicity induced by hydraulic fracturing. For small magnitude events reliable determination of corner frequency requires accurate knowledge of Qp and Qs which can be constrained using spectral ratio derived from perforation shots [Eaton et al. 2014]. A better constraint to stress drop may help us to distinguish the events directly associating with hydraulic fracking and induced tectonic earthquakes along the fault. ,2012,2017

Define the source model In coordination with the Caltech team we will help to defining the source for the benchmark scenario a hypothetical large rupture in Southern California based on the following general characteristics: Magnitude between 7 and 7.4 such that the teleseismic data clearly show finite-fault effects; thrust-faulting mechanism potentially on a buried fault; location in the greater L.A. region. Task 2: Generating the Synthetic Data for finite fault Source Imaging In coordination with Caltech team we will generate synthetic seismograms for the benchmark of finite fault source imaging methods. Two sets of synthetic data will be produced. The first set of data is constructed precisely using 1D earth model. The data noise caused by scattering-attenuation in earth crust structure will be included in the second set of synthetic data.  Task 3: Finite fault inversion using local and teleseismic waveforms Finite fault inversions using local and teleseismic data will be conducted. The impact of inaccurate Greens functions will be investigated. ,2012,2017

The Saugus is variably deformed across numerous active faults in Los Angeles and Ventura Counties and its inferred age is commonly used to quantify fault slip rates. Yet because the formation is diachronous across the region and few absolute ages exist fault slip rates on many of the largest faults in Southern California are poorly constrained. Until recently the age of Saugus strata (0.2- 2 Ma) lay outside the range of applicability of existing Quaternary geochronological techniques. However with the advent of recent advances in cosmogenic nuclide burial dating (36Cl/10Be isochron dating) which is capable of precisely dating (uncertainty <5-10%) strata of this age a new opportunity exists to determine the age of these tectonically significant strata. The resulting chronology of the Saugus Formation will directly contribute to and reduce uncertainties in earthquake hazards assessments associated with the USGS Earthquake Hazard Program UCERF3 and the proposed SCEC Ventura Special Fault Study Area. The primary focus of this research is to resolve the two-fold uncertainty in the existing fault slip rate (5.9 mm/a and 12.5 mm/a) of the Oak Ridge fault (ORF) which extends for ~40 km through urbanized Ventura County. Rates are based on the inferred age of the Saugus Formation with the 2-fold range in the rate reflecting the uncertainty in the upper age of Saugus strata (200-500 ka). Funds from this grant will be used to conduct fieldwork including geologic mapping and identification of propitious sites for cosmogenic sampling of the top and the bottom of the Saugus Formation. Fieldwork will focus along a North-South transect from the across the Oak Ridge hangingwall north of Moorpark California where a thick section of Saugus strata are preserved in the Happy Campy syncline. ,2012,2017

Develop better models of friction in fault gouge through reformulation of the STZ theory in terms of concepts more appropriate for strictly granular systems (perfectly hard spheres) in which there is no intrinsic energy scale to extract the broad spectrum of transition rates and trapping volumes and to capture inherent variability arising from the broad range of grain sizes in fault gouge.  Develop a multi-scale approach to the dynamic rupture problem through the resolution of dynamics that arise from these constitutive laws and the material properties of the fault gouge to obtain predictive results for dissipation and fracture from laboratory to tectonic scales.  Assess the heat flow paradox through the analysis of energy balance and thermal heating during large earthquakes based on general thermodynamic principles as well as specific information regarding the materials and failure mechanisms that occur in faults.  Design control techniques for improving seismic response of engineering structures that are motivated by our better understanding for the role of entropic deformation in dissipating energy and increasing toughness in systems like fault gouge and abalone shells. ,2012,2017

Our focus is on three experimental paradigms that occur in shear flow--- compactivity comminution and thermally induced changes in material properties. Each of these is of interest to the SCEC Fault and Rock Mechanics community and each has become accessible theoretically based on advances in STZ theory made in the last year. Our goal is to provide a first-principles quantitative interpretation of the great wealth of experimental data on fault gouge that to date has been treated phenomenologically. The advantage of a physics-based approach is that it enables extrapolation from the lab to the field. In the first project we will connect our theory of granular hard-sphere systems [Lieou and Langer 2012] to the phenomenon of auto-acoustic compaction-- the suppression of shear dilatancy by means of internal acoustic vibration—in steady shear flows which was recently observed in laboratory experiments [Elst Brodsky Bas and Johnson 2012]. We will examine how the STZ compactivity (which characterizes local volume fluctuations) is influenced by the shear rate and account for the apparent reduction in porosity due to acoustic vibrations generated at intermediate shear velocities. In the second project we will examine frictional weakening mechanisms associated with grain breakage. This involves augmentation of the original STZ theory to incorporate the effects of broad distributions of particle sizes and STZ transition barriers as was done recently to characterize aspects of the glass transition [Langer 2012] as well as physical mechanisms for granular fracture and wear [Mair and Abe 2011]. In geophysical applications the distribution of particle sizes may be responsible for frequency dependent response and variability in friction characteristics [Marone and Scholz 1989]. Grain breakage is expected to lead to frictional weakening and provides a significant pathway for energy dissipation that will help account for the lack of thermal heating during earthquakes. In the third project we will build on our recent work involving extensions of STZ theory that include thermally varying material properties [Elbanna and Carlson 2012]. The next phase will focus on shear banding as an additional weakening mechanism in order to model more realistically the shearing response of gouge layers at high strain rates. We will compare our results with laboratory experiments of Sone and Shimamoto [2009] that exhibit strain localization and rapid velocity weakening. ,2012,2017
507p,Ralph Archuleta,2/1/12,1/31/17,25000,University of Southern California,Institutes of higher education,20121443,SCEC4 Participation Project E: Dynamic Ruptures with Off-Fault Dissipation Processes: Constraints on Energy Partition Size-Dependent Levels of Prestress and Ground Motion Predictions,We propose to critically investigate the different modes of energy partition in earthquakes and the relevant implications on ground motions rupture speed and levels of prestress by doing self-consistent dynamic rupture simulations. The primary focus is to estimate the relative contribution of on and off-fault dissipation mechanism to the total energy budget. We will start by investigating the conditions under which a steady slip pulse can propagate on a velocity- weakening friction interface embedded in an elasto-plastic bulk. Steady propagation will allow us to examine the relationship between the width of the plastically deforming zone surrounding the fault and the constant width of the slip pulse. Because steady propagation does not emit radiated energy accurate bounds can be placed in this case on the energy dissipated in the inelastic and frictional processes. Steady propagation will also allow us to investigate in a more systematic way the effect of perturbations in the material properties material response and prestress on the rupture dynamics including variability in rupture speed maximum slip rate and ultimately rupture arrest. We will also address several seismologically-relevant questions. For example we will be examine the effect of off-fault plasticity on seismic observables like rupture speed acceleration to limiting speed in sub-shear ruptures transition to super shear and slip rate functions (in terms of the maximum and the average values of slip rates). Moreover we will also be able to assess the impact of off-fault dissipation on the high frequency content of ground motion. This is relevant for developing physically-based models for ground motion prediction. The project will accomplish the following tasks: a. Quantify the magnitude of on- and off-fault dissipation and their relative contribution to the earthquake energy budget for different friction laws (rate and state law/slip weakening law). b. Constrain the absolute levels of prestress consistent with the different modes of ruptures (cracks vs pulses) with and without the presence of off-fault dissipation mechanisms. c. Investigate the effect of off-fault dissipation on high frequency ground motion. ,2012,2017

Dynamic rupture model for Elmore Ranch earthquake. Although the Elmore Ranch Fault (ERF) earthquake is relatively simple (most researchers have treated it as a point source) we want to construct a more comprehensive stress model for the ERF earthquake. We want to construct the initial stress on the ERF fault first using existing methods (e.g. Hauksson 1994) considering its local tectonic context and fault geometry and also taking into account the aftershock sequence of the ERF earthquake during the 12 hours preceding the Superstition Hills Fault (SHF) earthquake. 2. Evaluate the stress perturbation on the SHF due to the Elmore Ranch earthquake. Based on the results from Step 1 as well as the location and focal information of the aftershock sequence of the ERF earthquake we will evaluate the stress perturbation on the main SHF. We will account for the fault geometry with great care to insure the relative accuracy of the Coulomb stress change estimates. It is obvious that the MW 6.2 ERF earthquake will have a major influence on the SHF nucleation. 3. Dynamic rupture model for Superstition Hills earthquake. We are going to combine the results from first two steps as outlined and previous research to constrain our stress model. We will take into account the heterogeneous velocity structure such as variable basement depth material property contrast across the fault as well as the non-planar feature of the fault (gradual fault strike changes segment stepover). We wish to integrate as much previous research as possible to construct our rupture dynamics model. We want to construct an initial stress field that could produce the key rupture patterns obtained from the observations. The relocated aftershock dataset gives us a chance to look at the possibility of stress transfer and triggering. The strong motion waveforms and the surface rupture measurements place strong constraints on the stress conditions in the upper kilometers which have almost no aftershocks in the double difference catalog. In particular we will analyze the stress conditions for the dynamic rupture model paying specific attention to the emergent nucleation and the partitioning of the seismic radiation into and high- and low-frequency energy. ,2012,2017

Several kinematic and dynamic rupture scenarios (Graves et al. 2008; Olsen et al. 2009) had been created to artificially break a 305 km long segment of the San Andreas fault from Bombay Beach on the Salton Sea to Lake Hughes 20 km northwest of Palmdale. Multiple groups have preformed the deterministic ground motion modeling for low frequencies (<1Hz) using SCEC CVM4 velocity structure and some of results were in good agreement (Bielak et al. 2010). Graves et al. (2008) also generated the broadband (010 Hz) ground motion simulations which combines a 3D deterministic approach at low frequencies (<1 Hz) with a semi-stochastic approach at high frequencies (>1 Hz). Currently this unique dataset has been used yearly for the ShakeOut earthquake drill which had 8.6 million participants this year. Here we propose to use it as a benchmark to test algorithms of quick finite fault inversion and ground motion prediction. We propose to address the following questions: 1) How quick can we determine the focal mechanism seismic moment of this scenario earthquake using the new MDC approach? 2) How quick can a finite fault source model based on current algorithm be available? 3) What is the spatial-temporal resolution using current strong motion and high rate GPS stations? 4) Can we improve the results with additional stations? If so where are their locations? Note that the previous simulations produced the waveforms at dense surface grids allowing us to address this subject without additional expensive forward calculations. 5) How well will the predicted strong ground motion be? Considering the limited waveform information used to constrain the realtime finite fault the quick solution might not be very precise. Then what is the quality of the predicted ground motion parameters such as PGV and intensity? In the end as suggested by committee efforts will focus on internally operating this realtime system in UCSB and USGS Pasadena office. We also attempt to incorporate the USGS realtime GPS data flow into the system. ,2013,2017

Because of their arrivals and the closeness of the recording station to the fault one can deduce that the level of scattering of these waves is not that meaningful. Scattering increases in a diffusive way with distance and travel time (Zeng et al. 1990) making it difficult for CODA to show up at such short distances. Therefore a plausible assumption is that there must be complexity at the rupture fronts of earthquakes for very small scales (Gusev 2012). With these important observations it is necessary to study in detail the rupture front complexity and to answer the question: Is the rupture front continuous and smooth across the fault? If we find that rupture front is not smooth or continuous across the fault then a natural follow up question would be how will this complexity at smaller scales affect ground motion intensity measures (GMIs) such as PGA PGV and Arias Intensity? If we find that the rupture front is not continuous or smooth then the effect of the irregularity in the rupture front must be included into current kinematic ground motion simulation techniques such as Schmedes et al. (SAL 2010). ,2013,2017

One of the most critical factors affecting ground motion is attenuation both regional and site specific. To our knowledge there have been no systematic attempts to determine the attenuation parameterized by ? (explained in the next paragraph) in Central California (CC) a region that hosts vital infrastructure such as the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant and several dams all of which are vulnerable to high-frequency ground motion (Muto 2015). The effective attenuation of seismic waves has been approximated by Futterman (1962) and Knopoff (1964) with the following equation A(rf) = exp(-πfr/?Qeff) where r is distance away from the fault f is frequency Qeff is effective seismic quality factor of S-waves and ? is S-wave velocity of the medium. There are many causes for seismic attenuation of waves but the two main recognized physical processes of attenuation have been pointed out to be anelasticity (Qin) and scattering (Qscat) (Dainty 1981) where the effective attenuation can be written as 1/Qeff = 1/Qin +1/Qscat. This relationship shows the difficulty in determining the relative contributions of anelasticity and scattering to the effective attenuation. In spite of this difficulty it has long been recognized that Qscat is frequency dependent (e.g. Jin et al. 1994). If the contribution of scattering to effective attenuation is significant then Qeff should also be frequency dependent. Cormier (1982) proposed a model for attenuation based on the integration along a ray path such that A(f) = A0exp(-πtf) with t = ∫path dr/(?Qeff). As the waves come to the surface the waves experience a major increase in t an argument that inspired Anderson and Hough (1984) to propose a model based on a linear decrease of the log-amplitudes of the Fourier amplitude Spectrum (FAS) of ground motion. They called the slope of this decay ? such that A(f) = A0exp(-π?f) which implies that Qeff is frequency independent. They also concluded that ? increases with distance away from the fault which is interpreted as the regional anelastic attenuation modeled as ?(r)= ?0 + mr where ?0 is the intercept of ? at zero distance and m is the slope of ?(r) as a function of distance. ,2016,2017

The PBIC is currently managed at the Earth Research Institute (ERI) by Dr. Jamison Steidl with support from undergraduate student laboratory assistants from the department of geological sciences and electrical and computer engineering. The ability for SCEC to respond rapidly to a major southern California earthquake with the deployment of seismographs in the near-source region was a catalyst for the creation of the PBIC and is a critical asset of SCEC earthquake research community. This has been highlighted recently by the successful deployment of PBIC equipment in the 2010 El MayorCucapah earthquake as well as the 2008 shakeout experiments along the southern San Andreas. Other PBIC successful RAMP deployments occurred in conjunction with the 2004 Parkfield and 2003 San Simeon earthquakes as well as the four major earthquake sequences in the previous decade (1992 M6.1 Joshua Tree and M7.3 Landers 1994 M6.7 Northridge and 1999 M7.1 Hector Mine). The ability to conduct individual PI driven research experiments in between these major earthquake sequences using PBIC equipment is another very important asset. One of the main goals of the PBIC is to facilitate research in the earthquake community by providing readily accessible seismic monitoring stations for deployment in the southern California region. This year the Portable Instrument Center is starting to upgrade the data acquisition technology to current real-time systems capable of integrating directly with the SCSN operations. Over the course of SCEC3 using its two newer real-time stations the PBIC has demonstrated the capability to deploy and integrate its stations into the regional network providing high-quality observations that are being used for earthquake locations and shake map applications. These stations have proven to be dependable and require very little maintenance. The previous generation of SCEC portable equipment is now coming up on two decades of operations. This older equipment is no longer completely reliable or cost-effective to deploy as it requires regular site visits and post-processing efforts. Data recovery is about 75% in the winter months and as low as 50% in the summer months due to the age of the equipment and failure of the older SCSI hard drives in the warmer summer temperatures. This year equipment will be added to provide a third modern real-time station to be used by the SCEC community as well as maintenance and operations of the other two currently deployed stations.

These important structures are potentially linked by a fault section (the Southern San Cayetano fault) for which slip rates do not currently exist. Developing the first radiometric chronology of deformed deposits will directly contribute to and reduce uncertainties in earthquake hazards assessments associated with the SCEC5 research priorities WGCEP goals and the USGS National Seismic Hazard Mapping Program. First we will develop precise ages for multiple river terraces and alluvial fans which are differentially deformed across and along strike of the San Cayetano and Pitas Point fault systems. We will in turn use these ages to develop high-resolution deformation rates on these hazardous but poorly understood faults where current greater than two-fold uncertainty on rates exists. Finally we will use the spatial distribution of slip rates along strike and between adjacent faults to test controversial subsurface fault geometry (ramp versus non-ramp models) and fault interaction models. ,2017,2018

Organizations the SCEC borehole instrumentation program collaborates with include Caltech/USGS ANSS/NSMP and the California Geological Survey. Other collaborators include the UC San Diego HPWREN program the NSF EarthScope PBO program at UNAVCO and also a NSF funded project to image the San Jacinto Fault zone which has been leveraged along with USGS funding to include the installation of additional shallow borehole sensors along the San Jacinto fault which are now part of the Anza Network. In 2015 the SCEC borehole program began a new collaboration with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission in support of the UCSB Geotechnical Array Monitoring Project previously funded by the NSF NEES program. The NRC provides continued support for the web-based data dissemination portal and real-time continuous monitoring operations and data processing software an important leveraged component of the SCEC borehole program. ,2017,2018

We will use a non-parametric approach (Andrews 1986; Castro et al 1990) to estimate simultaneously source and path parameters for the SSN region. To reduce the variability of observations we propose to incorporate additional constraints into the method of Andrews (1986) and Castro et al. (1990) by using the ratios of ground motion spectra produced by two earthquakes whose hypocenters are close to each other and recorded at the same site. This additional constraint should eliminate the path and site conditions allowing us to isolate source effects. We will apply this new approach for the CC coastal dataset that we have already analyzed to see if we can improve on the estimates of the source parameters. Several networks in SSN record strong ground motion with stations maintained by both Northern and Southern California Earthquake Centers (NCEC SCEC) the USGS and the California Geological Survey (CGS). Because we will be working with a limited dataset in the Sierra Nevada we first want to test the proposed method with datasets that are more extensive as well as datasets that include recordings in deep boreholes in order to better estimate the site conditions. The ideal place to do such work is with arrays that are maintained by Dr. Steidl at UCSB: Hollister downhole array (HEO) Garner Valley downhole array (GVDA) and Borrego Valley downhole array (BVDA). These data are available at: http://nees.ucsb.edu/data-portal. Once we have estimated all parameters we will compute stress drops apparent stress radiated energy and other source related parameters. ,2017,2018

The new systems use commercial grade cellular VPN routers or other available Internet based telemetry that allows for continuous transmission of data back to the USGS/Caltech component of CISN. Ongoing projects using PBIC equipment include: real-time deployment of the PBIC stations along the Elsinore fault zone; array deployment of 10 RefTek stations at Pinon Flat to monitor potential tremor activity in the region; and use of the broadband CMG-40T sensors at stations in the Anza regional network. In addition to support of field deployments the PBIC project will continue to maintain the existing pool of older instruments including the long-term loan equipment from the IRIS PASSCAL instrument center and newly acquired RefTek 72A series instruments from the DOE. Heavy involvement of undergraduates is an important part of the PBIC operations as these student laboratory assistants perform the majority of the routine maintenance work under the supervision of the PI and/or engineering staff at the Earth Research Institute. These students also participate in deployments getting hands-on training in the use of the PBIC seismic monitoring equipment and software processing tools. Outreach demonstrations and presentations to local K-12 schools is also a regular activity for the PBIC and will continue. ,2015,2020

The sub-discipline of earthquake rupture dynamics has been quite productive in determining the physics of these phenomena which have been observed in many earthquakes such as: The 1992 Mw7.2 Landers (Hart et al. 1993) and 1999 Mw7.1 Hector Mine (Oglesby et al. 2003) Not only is the rupture physics of these earthquakes important but also the near field ground motion they can produce to better inform the engineering community and to properly estimate earthquake hazard and risk. This is a priority for GMP: Develop and implement simulation methods for the modeling of bending faults and multi-segment ruptures. The highest priority need is for kinematic rupture generators for implementation of the UCSB method (Crempien and Archuleta 2015) on the Broadband Platform (BBP). Our goal is to determine plausible rupture prescriptions when generating ground motions from kinematic scenarios involving multiple fault segments or bending faults. Once the rules for simulating kinematic rupture on multiple-segment faults are specified we will validate the model within the realm of the Broadband Validation Exercise (Goulet et al. 2015; Dreger et al. 2015). Specifically for this proposal we will produce kinematic models for the 1992 Landers Mw7.3 and the 1999 Hector Mine Mw7.0 earthquakes. We will use the metrics of the Broadband Validation Exercise in comparing synthetic ground motions with observations. ,2016,2020

We also seek targets of opportunity for collaborations that will augment the number of borehole stations providing publicly available data in Southern California. In the past this program has been heavily leveraged through major funding from a single agency with the NSF Engineering Directorate for more than a decade (2002-2014) and more recently the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) from 2015-2017.

While the uses of the PBIC equipment remain unchanged over the years the PBIC is now in the process of modernizing its broadband instrument pool with posthole form factor sensors to adopt this more recent style of station deployment. The ability for SCEC to respond rapidly to a major southern California earthquake with the deployment of both weak- and strong-motion instruments in the near-source region was a catalyst for the creation of the PBIC and remains an important asset of SCEC seismology infrastructure and earthquake research community.

The ability to conduct individual PI driven research experiments in between these major earthquake sequences using PBIC equipment is another very important component of the PBIC program.

526p,Ralph Archuleta Chen Ji Toshiro Tanimoto,2/1/19,1/31/20,27000,University of Southern California,Institutes of higher education,,UCSB Broadband Kinematic Rupture Simulation With A Double Corner Source Spectrum,Statement of Work 1. In the current UCSB broadband simulation method (Schmedes et al. 2013; Crempien and Archuleta 2016) there is an explicit constraint: the final moment-rate spectrum should approximate an Aki-Brune single corner spectrum that has an a priori corner based on an assumed stress drop. (The temporal parameters related to the rupture time and the slip-rate functions of each subfault are continuously adjusted in an inner loop until the spectrum of source moment-rate function approximates a specified Aki-Brune spectrum.) As shown by the Allmann and Shearer (2009) spectrum this will lead to underestimation of the acceleration high frequency spectral level. The first priority is to replace the single corner spectrum with a double corner spectrum based on Ji and Archuleta (2018). 2. While we will continue to use spatial correlation for slip (???2) we will replace the regions of high correlation with crack-like asperities (Boatwright 1988). These regions will still produce slip with ???2wavenumber and thus ???2 spectral decay (Herrero and Bernard 1994). This is similar to what is done by Irikura and Miyake (2011). However the location of the asperities will be randomly selected through the von Karman spatial correlation pattern which itself is randomly generated with a given correlation length (Mai and Beroza 2002). 3. We will explore how the asperities will fail in time. Initially we will be guided by the work of Das and Kostrov (1983 1985) Fukuyama and Madariaga (2000) and Dunham et al. (2003). The dynamic solutions indicate that rim of the asperity breaks first and then collapses inward. The timing of the overall rupture front and the timing of the asperity have to be coordinated. 4. We will re-run the SCEC broadband validation problems (Goulet et al. 2015). ,2019,2020

This project explores a new path towards improved predictions of Arctic sea ice. We are investigating how teleconnections between tropical sea surface temperatures (SST) and high latitude circulation patterns can be exploited for sea ice predictions. Recent climate change in the Arctic is generally attributed to anthropogenic drivers and related feedbacks between sea ice the ocean and the atmosphere. However work by Ding et al. (2014) and others (e.g. Trenberth et al. 2014) suggest that tropical Pacific SST variability is important in modulating recent Arctic climate variability by influencing the high-latitude atmospheric circulation. So far these papers have examined the teleconnection between tropical SSTs and Arctic circulation and surface air temperatures. One unresolved question is how much does this tropical-Arctic teleconnection affect sea ice variability and predictability? This project aims to fill that gap. Indeed preliminary results suggest that these links with sea ice exist. This work will focus on the implications of this link for seasonal predictability of sea ice and explore how a hierarchy of models captures this link and can be used and improved to enhance Arctic sea ice prediction. ,2016,2019

Preliminary research focused on existing datasets spanning the Brazilian regions of Matto Gross and Pará. Consistent with previous studies we found remarkably few violations of the Soy Moratorium. However we also found no evidence to indicate that the Soy Moratorium caused observed reductions in deforestation and soy conversion. To control for differences in public policies across Brazilian states and to take advantage of available datasets our preliminary analysis chose to focus upon the states of Mato Grosso and Pará. However prior assessments have highlighted contrasting rates of deforestation in the Amazon and the Cerrado portion of Maranhão Tocantins Piauí and Bahia (Matopiba) as evidence of the moratoriums impact (Gibbs et al. 2015). The spatial scope of our research must be expanded to assess whether the null result found within Matto Gross and Pará holds across the Amazon. In this proposed research we will expand the spatial scope of our analysis to include Maranhão Tocantins Piauí and Bahia. Across this expanded study region we will use quasi-experimental econometric methods to estimate the causal impact of the soy moratorium. Furthermore we will explore spatial variations in impacts from the Soy Moratorium as a function of the stringency and enforcement of public policies and the cleared land bank in each of these regions. In addition we will explore the possibility of using the assembled datasets to contrast the effectiveness of the Soy Moratorium to the Cattle Moratorium. ,2018,2019

Attempts at creating a facies model for hyperpycnal flow deposits are based on either ancient examples where their presence can only be inferred from sedimentary characteristics or modern studies that sample the flows themselves but not necessarily their deposits. The study of Quaternary systems bridges the gap between modern processes which provide predictive metrics of sedimentary characteristics and ancient deposits representing petroleum reservoirs. The few existing Quaternary examples of deposits produced by hyperpycnal flows focus on the broad scale of deposition and rarely describe individual geomorphic features resulting from hyperpycnal flows. A recent marine bathymetric survey of the northern Santa Barbara Channel continental shelf by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) revealed the presence of shallow-water submarine fans immediately offshore of several small mountainous streams. Based on observations of modern discharges from these and similar systems in the northern Santa Barbara Channel we hypothesis that these geomorphic features represent the deposits of hyperpycnal flows and dense bedload-dominated underflows emanating from steep mountain catchments. The purpose of this proposal is to characterize these features using high-resolution seismic profiles sediment grab samples underwater camera operations and shallow cores. The characterization of these deposits will allow an evaluation of their potential for reservoir quality sands and provide one of the few modern examples of a subaqueous fan delta from a semi-arid setting. ,2013,2016

UCSB will also perform a series of float deployments in the coastal ocean and evaluate both float performance and sensor data following the Float Test Plan developed in Task 1. Float and sensor performance will be evaluated through a series of test deployments off the Southern California coast. For the first set of test deployments floats will be deployed in the morning and retrieved before sunset (daily deployments). This will occur on roughly five separate days over a range of environmental conditions in month three of the project. The second type of test deployment will involve deployment of roughly 5 floats for a period of 24 to 48 hours. This test deployment will be used to demonstrate the float performance metrics indicated in Section 1.4.1 of the BAA. Microstar drifters will be deployed alongside floats to ensure tracking and recoverability of each float during its test phase. Large spatial gradients in oceanographic conditions (i.e. winds and waves) typically exist in Southern California waters (due to pronounced headlands islands and a curved coastline) and will be taken advantage of to ensure testing in a range of conditions. ,2018,2019

Quantitative assessments typically consider a single source whereas qualitative assessments may include multiple sources but rarely identify response variables. As a step toward understanding cumulative effects of underwater sound we are developing complementary quantitative and qualitative methods for assessing the aggregated sounds from multiple sources received by marine mammals. As a case study to refine the transferable methods we are assessing sounds received by migrating bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea during their 2008 autumn migration. The quantitative method models the sound field from multiple sources and simulates movement of a population through it. The qualitative method uses experts to assess responses of individuals and populations to sound sources and identify potential mechanisms. These methods increase the transparency of assessments.

These fisheries are very poorly understood relative to single-species target fisheries yet they feed millions of people. Their response to human-driven changes in freshwater dynamics is almost completely unexplored. The goal of our research is to better understand indiscriminate fisheries and their response to climate change using one of the largest and most dynamic indiscriminate fisheries in the world as a research testbed. The ecological and social implications of indiscriminate fisheries are particularly important for the world's poor. Major indiscriminate fisheries exist in inland freshwater systems in low-income countries where freshwater fish consumption is a very important part of nutritional security. Protein from large freshwater fisheries are of greatest importance in countries with annual GDP per capita of less than US$1000. Cambodia's freshwater fishery stands out as one of the largest contributors of animal protein to people living in poverty; major components of this fishery are indiscriminate. Here we will focus on the Tonle Sap Lake of Cambodia perhaps the world's largest indiscriminate fishery. The Tonle Sap system feeds approximately 3 million people directly and provides income for millions more. The productivity of the system relies on hydrologic dynamics that interact with land use dynamics making for a complicated system that is impacted in many ways by human actions and will be vulnerable in many dimensions to climate change. As a result of recent ministerial decisions on fisheries management the Tonle Sap represents a prime example of an indiscriminate fishery as well as a model of community control and management of a freshwater fishery. These attributes make it a rich resource to inform management of other indiscriminate fisheries and improve the living conditions of communities that depend upon them. ,2014,2017

Climate change is perceived to be quite costly there is a growing literature which presents estimates of the costs of rising temperatures in different countries. However at the moment adaptation mechanisms especially provided by means of free-markets are studied much less. While there are some studies indicating that adaptation is likely to help the exact scope and the magnitudes of the effect of various adaptation mechanisms on climate change costs are not well understood. This research will help fill in this gap in the literature. Prior research on migration as an adaptation mechanism allowed for the assessment of the efficacy of migratory responses as a means of adapting to rises in temperature. In this effort I found that migration while having a somewhat small effect on average will be very helpful in reducing the costs for the areas which are extremely hit hard by the climate change (notably Florida and some currently densely populated areas on the East Coast). That paper provided a methodological contribution by constructing a discrete choice model which explicitly accounts for general equilibrium effects. This model takes into account that while population density might affect individual migratory decisions it is also a function of those same individual decisions on the aggregate level. Currently my research accounts for general equilibrium effects for population density only. One might expect that wages might change as a result of both migration (due to change in labor demand) and climate change (supply side shocks). These will be the next steps in my research. ,2014,2017

OSL is an ideal geochronometer for this study for a number of reasons. Fossil corals on the Gaviota Coast are sparse making U-series dating impractical. There are occasional mollusk shell beds but radiocarbon dating cannot be relied upon completely because the terrace ages may be beyond the upper limits of radiocarbon dating (~45-50 ka without isotopic enrichment; Walker 2005). West of the SBSYF this is almost certainly the case. Fortunately marine terrace quartz sands are abundant and have ideal characteristics for OSL dating i.e. a depositional environment and texture (fine-medium grain size well-sorted) that suggest a high degree of bleaching (Nelson et al. 2015). These characteristics mitigate potential concerns with OSL dating. Moreover local terrace sands have been shown to be amenable to OSL (Gurrola et al. 2014) further affirming the methods utility in this coastal setting. Lastly the upper limits (~150-200 ka depending on dose rate) and resolution of OSL (± 5-10%; Rhodes 2011) are sufficient to date and distinguish between the expected terrace ages of ~45 ka and ~80 ka. ,2017,2018

Environmental changes that threaten the quality of montane water supplies therefore have social economic and ecological implications. For example because dusts can transport nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) processes increasing dust inputs to ecosystems can degrade water quality. In drought-impacted regions like California fallow agricultural fields may serve as fertilizer-rich dust sources. Because in the Sierra Nevada Mountains—Californias principal water source—P availability drives landscape development understanding how dusts impact these ecosystems is critical from an ecological and water management perspective. A long-held paradigm in ecosystem science postulates that while N is derived from the atmosphere P originates from the weathering of rock where denudation processes control P supply during ecosystem development. Over time these processes deplete P-bearing minerals leading to a terminal steady state of profound P-limitation. Paradoxically in high-elevation ecosystems of the Sierra Nevada shifts from P- to N-limitation and enrichment of soils and lake sediments with P suggest that over time P availability is not decreasing—rather it is increasing. In these P-poor granite-derived systems increasing P enhances loss to streams and lakes lowering water quality and may be altering the balance ecosystem C:N:P ratios. Changes in nutrient stoichiometry can affect plant and microbial activity and diversity altering rates of primary production and organic matter decomposition. Exceptional drought covered >50% of the state with conditions expected to worsen.

It has been determined that the Rochford mining district which lies just to the south of the Homestake district is a promising new prospect for exploration. This area has been selected by Great Lakes Exploration due to 1) USGS maps reporting significantly anomalous gold values 2) similarity of mineralization to the Homestake mine and 3) the relative lack of mining claims throughout the district. Great Lakes Exploration has expressed a need for a more detailed geologic understanding of the Rochford area in order to continue their exploration and this proposal outlines the goals specific types of work research plan and anticipated results that we will aim for throughout the next two years. We propose to undertake an integrated geologic framework study with the goal of providing Great Lakes Exploration with a more comprehensive understanding of the stratigraphy mineralization and structural controls for the Rochford and surrounding areas. Our focus will be mainly on mapping the Rochford area geology focusing on iron formation trends and structural features with a focus on identifying structural controls or influence on the gold occurrences. Our overriding objective is to gain a better understanding of the geologic framework of the Rochford area with the expectation that this understanding will clarify why the anomalous gold occurrences appear where they do including how and when the mineralization occurred and how much subsequent structural disruption there has been. We believe that this type of geologic framework study will significantly aid efforts to find any potentially economically valuable targets in the area and help guide efforts to extend these studies throughout the region. ,2013,2015

From a school of anchovies avoiding a shark to a swarm of locusts engulfing a cornfield these impressive displays afford a unique opportunity to directly observe fundamental ecological processes in real time. While the biology of aggregating behaviors is relatively well studied in model species of small animals (e.g. minnows locusts) the challenge of observing groups of large bodied animals in the wild has hindered our understanding of this most basic phenomenon in ecosystems worldwide. However recent advancements in remote sensing technologies like unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and very high-resolution satellite imagery (VHRS) have opened up exciting new pathways for studying aggregating behaviors of large vertebrates in situ and at unprecedented spatial scales. We propose to use novel remote sensing technology and automated image analysis to experimentally test the ecological causes of aggregation behaviors in migratory wildebeest in the Greater Serengeti Ecosystem of Tanzania. Specifically we aim to identify the social and environmental processes that give rise to the spatial patterns observed in wildebeest herds across the landscape. By establishing this link we hope to advance our understanding of the ecology of collective decision making in animals and provide conservation partners in Tanzania with a new methodological framework for remotely monitoring the behavior of large mobile species across this flagship ecosystem. ,2017,2018

A key puzzle piece however was the 64 acre privately owned Ocean Meadows golf course property which limited public access to the larger open space and created a legacy of adverse wetland impacts resulting from the filling of the upper arms of Devereux Slough with soil from the adjacent uplands. Thanks to the work of The Trust for Public Land the former golf course was purchased and donated to UCSB. The goal of the larger project is to return this golf course to its original wetland status and incorporate public access and education in the process. During the next one to two years UCSB will be working on the permitting process and preparing proposals to fund the restoration component. This time span provides a window of opportunity to engage the community in the process and to develop a stewardship role for the neighboring families and Goleta residents. The goal of this effort is to provide a year of monthly family-oriented educational and engaging weekend events which will connect local residents to this newly acquired property and to our organization. Benefits to the community members include the opportunity to learn about our local ecology to participate in the restoration vision and process and to work as a community in the Ellwood-Devereux open space that is being restored and preserved for future generations.

For the past five years the Knapp research group at the Sierra Nevada Aquatic Research Laboratory has been assisting the zoo in their efforts related to recovery of the endangered mountain yellow-legged frog (Rana muscosa Rana sierrae). During this time we have collected early life stage animals for captive rearing and reintroduced captive-reared animals back into the wild. One of the major threats to the mountain yellow-legged frog is the amphibian chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis; Bd). This novel pathogen has been spread worldwide by global commerce and has caused the decline or extinction of hundreds of amphibian species. Given the high susceptibility of mountain yellow-legged frogs to this pathogen as part of the captive-rearing protocol animals are frequently screened for the presence of Bd. Because the Bd assay requires highly specialized and expensive equipment that the zoo does not have access to the zoo requires assistance in analyzing these samples.

We propose to collect detailed datasets at several field installations in the Santa Clara River Basin which will enable us to ascertain: a) the evolving access to subsurface water by riparian trees; b) the relative magnitude of their use of groundwater particularly during stressful periods; and c) their corresponding growth responses. Notably it will allow us to assess the groundwater dependency of riparian forests in this basin which has experienced marked declines in water tables and subsurface soil moisture due to the recent drought. The data from this study will provide new understanding of water availability to riparian forests and their use of this water. These results will be relevant to surface water management efforts including developing aquifer recharge strategies and timing that benefit riparian forest ecosystems. Specifically we will: 1) fingerprint distinct differences between potential endmember source waters to trees; 2) assess what water Salix and Poplulus spp. are using in the Santa Clara basin on annual and seasonal timescales including likely depths of water access to roots and water source switching; and 3) quantify the growth response of these trees to fluctuations in water availability. Collectively these data will indicate the patterns of groundwater use by keystone riparian trees. Due to the ubiquity of the focal species and similar ecohydrological responses of closely-related taxa the results are projected to be applicable to riparian systems throughout California and other dryland regions. ,2018,2019

(France),"Private agencies, foundations",SB150037,Collaborative Project Between Total and University of California Santa Barbara: Developing and testing a method to simultaneously inverting moment tensor solutions and locations for micro-seismic events near a high velocity interface,Barnett CEDF project was conducted on May 2011 including nine stages of hydraulic fracturing experiments on two horizontal wells CEDF 5H and CEDF 8H. To achieve a better determination to the source depth every stage was recorded by 2 down-hole arrays. However this dataset has three known limitations. First the two arrays were not synchronized. Second the relative aperture of the observational arrays is small. If assuming the spatial interval of two geophones is 50 ft the length of the vertical array is about 600 ft and that of the horizontal array is around 400 ft. Both of them are much smaller than the distances between the micro-seismic events and the closest geophones which are up to 3500 ft. Third the hydraulic fracturing treatments were conducted along two horizontal wells which locate right above a high velocity layer. The first arrivals of induced seismicity then can be either direct Pd phase or head wave Pn phase. The error in phase identification leads to the error in locations. A better velocity structure is needed. Considering these limitations the source locations based on only the P and S wave picks shall always include significant error in particular the source depth. Here we conduct a synthetic experiment to explore the difference in observed waveforms caused by the source depth relative to the high velocity interface. Analogous to the velocity structure found during Barnett project in this synthetic experiment we let the P-wave velocity change from 3.5 km/s (14000 ft/s) to 4.5 km/s (18000 ft/s) across the interface. ,2014,2015

The new tracers were boron-10 (as 10B enriched borate) and radio-sulfur (35S). A multi-tracer experiment with the conservative anion bromide (Br-) 10B and heat was conducted at the test basin near the San Gabriel MAR operations (travel time of a few months) to evaluate the relative performance of the different tracers. This basin is managed by the Water Replenishment District of Southern California (WRD). The experiment showed that 10B and heat are not conservative during near field transport and therefore should not be used as a replacement for SF6. At two other southern California MAR facilities WRDs Rio Hondo Spreading Grounds and Orange County Water Districts Kraemer Basin time series measurements were made for 35S. The significant result of this experiment is that S should be considered as a viable replacement for SF6. This study addressed issues critical to the operation and regulation of many water reuse projects in California the United States and elsewhere around the world by increasing the available tools for evaluating travel times and hydraulic connections near MAR operations. These data are critical for understanding water quality changes that occur in the subsurface and permitting (in California). Although the California Air Resources Board (CARB) is regulating emission of SF6 a provision was included to allow for exemptions if the researchers can demonstrate a method for the introduction SF6 into the recharge water that minimize its loss to the atmosphere. A new method was developed using a membrane contactor with a closed circulation system for SF6 to achieve the CARB requirement of minimal SF6 loss. ,2010,2014

Attempts at creating a facies model for hyperpycnal flow deposits are based on either ancient examples where their presence can only be inferred from sedimentary characteristics or modern studies that sample the flows themselves but not necessarily their deposits. The study of Quaternary systems bridges the gap between modern processes, which provide predictive metrics of sedimentary characteristics, and ancient deposits representing petroleum reservoirs. The few existing Quaternary examples of deposits produced by hyperpycnal flows focus on the broad scale of deposition and rarely describe individual geomorphic features resulting from hyperpycnal flows. A recent marine bathymetric survey of the northern Santa Barbara Channel continental shelf by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) revealed the presence of shallow-water submarine fans immediately offshore of several small mountainous streams. Based on observations of modern discharges from these and similar systems in the northern Santa Barbara Channel, we hypothesis that these geomorphic features represent the deposits of hyperpycnal flows and dense bedload-dominated underflows emanating from steep mountain catchments. The purpose of this proposal is to characterize these features using high-resolution seismic profiles, sediment grab samples, underwater camera operations, and shallow cores. The characterization of these deposits will allow an evaluation of their potential for reservoir quality sands and provide one of the few modern examples of a subaqueous fan delta from a semi-arid setting.",2013,2015
573p,Frank Davis David Stoms,12/11/08,11/26/10,269434,American Petroleum Institute,"Private agencies, foundations",,Biofuels and Biodiversity in California,Rising environmental economic and political concerns about the production and use of fossil fuels have led to a renewed interest in biofuels derived from dedicated energy crops or crop residues nationally and particularly in California (California Biomass Collaborative 2006). Fuel crop production also provides an economic opportunity for some farmers. A number of recent studies found encouraging evidence that the substitution of biofuels for fossil fuels could in many cases reduce environmental impacts such as eutrophication acidification and ecotoxicity and most importantly anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Sheehan et al. 2003 de Oliveira et al. 2005 Kim and Dale 2005 Hill et al. 2006 Tilman et al. 2006iHH). Little attention has been paid however to the potential impacts of fuel crop production on habitat and biodiversity. The impacts may not necessarily be negative however. For example planting perennial crops like switchgrass on idle cropland may improve habitat quality for some species (Perlack et al. 2005). Recent work by Tilman et al. (2006) showed that degraded agricultural land that was planted with a mixture of grassland perennials could produce more energy with superior reductions of GHGs without impacting food supply or native ecosystems. We could expect the biodiversity value of such restored lands would also increase. Some energy crop types are salt- tolerant and could help restore habitat quality by remediating high-salinity soils and associated pollution of wetlands in arid regions (BanÃÉuelos 2006 California Biomass Collaborative 2006). Before policy makers and business leaders commit heavily to large-scale production of biofuels the discussion needs to be informed about the potential impacts on biodiversity (Hanegraaf et al. 1998 Chan et al. 2004). For the current proposal we will conduct a statewide study of the potential effects on habitat of wildlife species associated with changes in crops crop patterns and agricultural practices under several scenarios of biofuels production. California has a modest demand for biofuel but demand is expected to increase rapidly especially with recent state policies. California requires a blend rate of 5.7% ethanol with fossil fuel in vehicles. It is also possible for vehicles to use blend rates of 10% and 20%. Current annual usage of ethanol is approximately 1 billion gallons with another 4 millions gallons of biodiesel (California Biomass Collaborative 2006). Currently California imports more than 95 percent of the biofuels used in-state (California Energy Commission 2007). The Governor‚Äôs Executive Order S-06-06 sets goals for increasing reliance on in-state production of biofuels specifically that California should produce at least 20 percent of the biofuels consumed in the state by 2010 40 percent by 2020 and 75% by 2050. The following tables indicate how those goals translate into gallons per year of production and estimates for area required to produce that volume if feedstocks were grown instate. These tables illustrate that hundreds of thousands of acres would need to be dedicated to producing biofuel feedstocks to meet even the short-term goal for 2010 at the low blend rates for both ethanol and biodiesel increasing to millions of acres by 2050 for all blend rates. Because of differences in energy efficiencies crop types have different land requirements. For instance only about half the area is required by sugar beets to meet the goals compared to corn. If corn stover can be feasibly and economically converted to ethanol along with conversion of the grain the land requirements for corn become comparable to those for sugar beets.,2008,2010

Quantitative assessments typically consider a single source whereas qualitative assessments may include multiple sources but rarely identify response variables. As a step toward understanding cumulative effects of underwater sound we are developing complementary quantitative and qualitative methods for assessing the aggregated sounds from multiple sources received by marine mammals. As a case study to refine the transferable methods we are assessing sounds received by migrating bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea during their 2008 autumn migration. The quantitative method models the sound field from multiple sources and simulates movement of a population through it. The qualitative method uses experts to assess responses of individuals and populations to sound sources and identify potential mechanisms. These methods increase the transparency of assessments.,2010,2014

Four drivers of land use change associated with climate change have been identified for study ‚Äì direct impacts on species distributions the influence of carbon markets land devoted to renewable energy productions and impacts on human systems that feedback to the biodiversity. The first of these land use change drivers is the effect of climate change directly on species ranges ‚Äì it will result in movements in species distributions and the tearing apart of ecosystems and reassembly into novel combinations of species. These changes can be modeled through a number of statistical techniques that relates species ranges to the climate the species find suitable. Modeling of this type is the focus of the project. It allows assessment of this direct effect on species and its interactions with other land use change drivers associated with climate change. Work integrating these direct impacts with other land use changes driven by climate change are included in the project.

A permitted discharger facing high costs to accommodate new growth or meet more stringent effluent limits can ‚Äútrade‚Äù for discharge reduction credits generated by another source having lower costs (e.g. an agricultural producer implementing conservation practices). Developing a regional trading program in the Ohio River Basin will require participation by multiple stakeholders and trading partners. Trading partners will likely include power companies POTWs regulators and non-point sources. Other key stakeholders will include but not limited to conservation and environmental organizations as well as constituent interest groups. Program design will require intensive stakeholder involvement over three to five years. The design of the trading framework will be shaped by several attributes that will constrain the overall program. These will include consistency with The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) trading policy and developing trading ratios or other factors to account for the position of the buyers and sellers over a large project area as well as for pollutant equivalency. Arrangements will need to be made between state regulatory agencies the Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation Commission (ORSANCO) and EPA to address how interstate trading will occur. Development of trading zones (or districts) and rules governing where buyers may purchase credits are two possible methods that will need to be developed to account for geographic scale. Potential drivers for trading in the Ohio River Basin include both localized and systemic water quality issues. On the local level water quality issues in various reaches of the Ohio River and its major tributaries include local eutrophication (related to phosphorus) algal blooms (taste and odor problems) ammonia (local toxicity) bacteria (localized Combined Sewer Overflow discharges and background NPSs) temperature (aquatic life and ammonia) flow (urban stormwater hydraulics) and acid mine drainage.,2010,2011
584p,Arturo Keller,1/1/12,12/31/12,48652,Electric Power Research Institute,"Private agencies, foundations",EP-P42266/C18443,Scientific Basis for Water Quality Trading,The purpose of this project is to develop a scientifically defensible protocol for water quality crediting. Although there are 85 water quality trading programs in the U.S. there are no peer-reviewed protocols to ensure these programs will achieve the promised in-stream benefits which creates liability for power companies who purchase those credits for permit compliance. This will be the first attempt to raise the caliber of WQ crediting protocols and may result in the only peer- reviewed publication demonstrating a scientifically-informed crediting approach. Water quality trading (WQT) is a flexible tool offering a mechanism to achieve additional economic and environmental benefits when used in conjunction with traditional command and control approaches for managing water quality in the United States. Analogous to carbon credit trading a permitted discharger facing high costs to accommodate new growth or meet more stringent water quality limits can ‚Äútrade‚Äù for credits generated by another source having lower costs (e.g. an agricultural producer implementing conservation practices). EPRI is spearheading the pilot testing of the largest WQT program in the world in the Ohio River Basin. During the implementation of this project one scientific gap in has become apparent: the absence of a rigorous scientifically-based crediting protocol. This effort will follow the successful model of EPRI‚Äôs Nitrous Oxide Protocol which lead to the first peer-reviewed carbon crediting protocol to be submitted to the Voluntary Carbon Standard (VCS) verification process (Climate Program Adam Diamant). While water quality trading still lacks an analogous body such as VCS for verifying the crediting system we believe that the only way to ensure that any WQT program stands on solid footing is to base it on a strong defensible scientific method. Without a scientifically robust crediting protocol the viability of WQT being accessible to power companies is seriously limited. The reason for this is that in WQT the credit buyer retains full liability for demonstrating that the purchased credits achieve the intended water benefits. If the credits fail (the credit seller fails to implement the necessary actions to generate in-stream benefits) the buyer will be liable by way of not be in compliance with their NPDES permit. The buyer will be subject to punishment for not meeting their permit limit. The seller will not be subject to disciplinary action. (This is contrast to carbon species or wetland credit markets where the buyer is absolved of all future liability after purchasing credits). While there are 85 WQT programs in the U.S power companies will not have the confidence to participate in these markets without more defensible crediting protocols. Therefore this effort if funded may break through the barriers for the power industry to use WQT to cost-effectively meet their water quality effluent permit limits.,2012,2012

The overarching concerns are the extent to which permanganate oxidation of TCE changes indigenous microbial communities and the longevity of observed community shifts. The specific questions being addressed are: 1) What are the indigenous microorganisms?; 2) Are they effective dechlorinators?; 3) What changes in population diversity are observed immediately after dosing with permanganate?; and 4) How do the populations recover after treatment? Fully answering Question 1 would involve clone library development and clone sequencing which is extremely time consuming and thus costly. However the results of such an effort could also enable answering Question 2. Questions 3 and 4 are more easily addressed via molecular fingerprinting methods as described below. Thus this focus on Questions 3 and 4 and suggest an alternative approach for addressing the concerns motivating Questions 1 and 2 i.e. whether dechlorinating populations are present before and after treatment.,2006,2009

Therefore, we will explore how water quality issue can be incorporated into mid-point approach and then integrated into water quantity issue after weighting. In parallel, we will explore the possibilities of combining water quality and water quantity issues into ecologically degraded area following end-point approach. An example of a simplified classification of water use categories can be drawn from looking at a nuclear power plant, as it withdraws water from a stream and part of the water withdrawn will be evaporated to the atmosphere and will not immediately come back to the same source of water, and the rest will come back to the water stream with certain quality alteration. The consumptive use portion of water withdrawn will not be available to the neighboring ecosystem, and therefore it adversely affects the production of water-constrained NPP of the area. This impact can be modeled using the framework developed by Pfister et al. (2009). However, the framework by Pfister et al. (2009) is not adequate for addressing the impacts associated with degradative use portion of the withdrawal. In order to quantify the impact of degradative use of water, we propose the following two approaches. A. Mid-point approach Use of acute toxicity data such as lethal concentration 50 (LC50) or chronic toxicity data such as no observed effect concentration (NOEC) is widely adopted to mid-point approaches for quantifying ecosystem health impacts (Guinée et al., 2002; Wenzel et al., 1997; Wenzel and Hauschild, 1997). In these approaches the impact of various human interventions to ecosystem 207 health is quantified using either the concentration of a pollutant that harms 50% of the total population of a certain species or the maximum level of intervention without observed effect. The impact of water quality alteration can be translated into relevant mid-point characterization factors following the same reasoning. For instance, it has long been known that certain larvae are highly sensitive to alteration of water temperature by power plants (see e.g., Hall, 1979). In this case, temperature-response curve provides similar data required to calculate characterization factors for ecosystem health impacts. Once degradative water use is quantified using mid-point approach, the result can be integrated with consumptive water use results by using normalization and weighting procedure (ISO 2006; Guinée et al., 2002). B. End-point approach Another option is to translate the damage on higher trophic level into NPP and use the ecologically degraded area following Pfister et al. (2009). Energy captured by NPP is partly transferred to the species in higher trophic level along the food-chain, and the rest is dissipated through respiration and decay. Therefore, in principle, the amount of energy held by certain species can be translated into NPP using energy balance approach (Suh, 2005). Under this framework, damages to the species in higher trophic level will have larger “NPP equivalency” as more energy is lost along the food web as it propagates. We will develop the framework using each of the two approaches. The two approaches will be compared using case studies on coal- and natural gas-powered electricity generation process. The case study will be based on life-cycle impact considering all direct and supply-chain water uses impacts.",2011,2012

With funding from the Coastal Conservancy, UCSB recently replaced the entire trail from Isla Vista to Coal Oil Point Reserve with a new 8 foot wide decomposed granite trail that is intended to reduce the amount of off-trail use and associated impacts. The new trail has been highly effective at concentrating traffic, and will greatly reduce the amount of disturbance to nearby native grassland, coastal shrub, and wetland habitats.

In addition the funding will allow CCBER to maintain and enhance the GVLT restoration implemented over the past year. West Campus Bluffs is a 37 acre area with amazing coastal views, easy access and is a unique opportunity to restore coastal grassland. It was recently protected from development through the 2004 Ellwood-Devereux Joint Open Space Agreement. The joint management committee (City of Goleta, UCSB, County of Santa Barbara) have been meeting over the past three years to collaborate on planning efforts for restoration, trails and signs. CCBER has been working with the State Coastal Conservancy and Coastal Fund on restoration associated with the new decomposed granite trail that runs the length of the bluff and GVLT supported restoration of the eastern bluff edge. This trail brings people to the larger 652 open space area protected through the joint agreement. Excitingly, and with GVLT support, CCBER is simultaneously working with TPL to acquire and restore the upper arms of Devereux Slough and South parcel. Thus, this area is important both ecologically and as an important aesthetic and practical access point to popular surfing points, snowy plover protection areas and future large scale restoration projects. Over the past year CCBER has implemented restoration of the bluff (funded by GVLT) and the trail edge (Coastal Fund support). These successful projects have been enthusiastically welcomed by bluff trail users. The restored areas are still establishing and we feel that the most valuable path to follow is to continue to maintain those areas while expanding the restoration on the western end where there is a clear threat from fennel and the opportunity to link the trail restoration to the existing vernal meadows. This will not only greatly enhance the visitor experience of being on a natural, native coastal bluff, but will also protect and enhance the restoration that has already been implemented from future weed invasion.",2012,2013

It has been determined that the Rochford mining district which lies just to the south of the Homestake district is a promising new prospect for exploration. This area has been selected by Great Lakes Exploration due to 1) USGS maps reporting significantly anomalous gold values 2) similarity of mineralization to the Homestake mine and 3) the relative lack of mining claims throughout the district. Great Lakes Exploration has expressed a need for a more detailed geologic understanding of the Rochford area in order to continue their exploration and this proposal outlines the goals specific types of work research plan and anticipated results that we will aim for throughout the next two years. We propose to undertake an integrated geologic framework study with the goal of providing Great Lakes Exploration with a more comprehensive understanding of the stratigraphy mineralization and structural controls for the Rochford and surrounding areas. Our focus will be mainly on mapping the Rochford area geology focusing on iron formation trends and structural features with a focus on identifying structural controls or influence on the gold occurrences. Our overriding objective is to gain a better understanding of the geologic framework of the Rochford area with the expectation that this understanding will clarify why the anomalous gold occurrences appear where they do including how and when the mineralization occurred and how much subsequent structural disruption there has been. We believe that this type of geologic framework study will significantly aid efforts to find any potentially economically valuable targets in the area and help guide efforts to extend these studies throughout the region.,2013,2015

Microbiological measurements of water samples collected within the plume will allow for characterizing bacterial indicators, indicator DNA, bacterial communities, and bacterial pathogens indicative of contamination (Holden, UCSB). While drifters provide a direct measure of transport pathways taken by surface water parcels, microbiological measurements provide 148 direct measures of microbial contaminant concentrations, as well as indigenous microbes, associated with the plume. Microbial communities associated with wastewater effluent discharged from the Montecito outfall are likely to be complex and distinct from the indigenous ocean microbial ecology, with subgroups and populations changing at varying rates due to multiple loss mechanisms occurring along the plume trajectory. While dispersion and eddy diffusion values (i.e. mixing rates) are accurately obtained from drifter data by considering the relative motion of drifter pairs, the application of these values to dynamic analyses, such as organisms, cannot be used to directly and completely predict the movement of organisms within the plume. Rather, a coupled fate and transport model of microbes within the plume trajectory will be developed based on measured concentrations of microbial constituents in space and time, advection and dispersion characteristics of the water, and nominated loss coefficients for individual groups of microbes. Loss coefficients will be estimated within the plume model by performing sensitivity analyses and discovering appropriately conservative bounds for estimated values. Overall, measurements of water properties, including microbiological contaminants, and subsurface current velocities will characterize the ambient ocean conditions, as well as the effects of effluent discharge on water quality around the outfall.",2007,2010

Warmer temperatures lead to earlier snowmelt and a transition from snow to rain dominated water inputs. Empirical and model-based studies have shown that, for the Western U.S., these changes will likely lead to significant shifts in the seasonal timing of streamflow (Stewart et al., 2004). Changes in the timing of water inputs will also alter seasonal soil wetting-drying patterns and soil-vegetation biogeochemical cycling processes that depend on moisture conditions The goal of this project is to characterize soil moisture and coupled ecosystem responses to climate-driven changes in timing of water inputs for a watershed located at the sensitive rain- snow transition zone within the southern California Sierra Nevada range. One of the key challenges in any investigation of soil moisture driven processes is accounting for spatial heterogeneity at multiple scales. Soil moisture is highly spatially variable and controls on this variation shift with spatial and temporal scale and extent. In snowmelt driven watersheds, soil hydraulic properties may dominate at very fine scales, while spatial variation in snow accumulation and melt, vegetation cover, radiation and micro-meteorology play varying roles at increasingly coarser scales. Soil moisture sampling directed at understanding how the system responds to climate variation must take into account these multiple controls. In this project, we develop a strategic soil moisture (and vegetation water flux) sampling strategy that is explicitly designed to capture spatial heterogeneity that will likely be important in characterizing system responses to inter-annual climate variability. We use an integrated field-sampling-hydrologic modeling approach to maximize the utility of measurements and then use these results in an assessment of how changes in snow accumulation and melt will alter soil moisture and its control on vegetation water use. Our research site has recently been established as the Sierra Critical Zone Observatory. This project leverages an extensive set of ongoing field measurements and links this work with other research initiatives, including several focused on soil biogeochemical cycling. One of the key contributions of this project will be the development and application of a strategic soil moisture and sap flux sampling design based on a physically-based, spatially distributed eco-hydrologic model and associated statistical analysis, ultimately to represent the impact of annual climate variability on dominant eco-hydrologic processes. We initially calibrate the model to reproduce existing soil moisture, sap-flow and streamflow data. We use the model to generate spatial- temporal patterns of snow, soil moisture and transpiration under historical and projected future climate. These patterns are then clustered to identify areas of hydrologic similarity, where similarity will be defined by inter-annual mean and variation of a suite of hydrologic indicators (e.g. seasonal trajectories of snowmelt, root-zone soil moisture storage, and evapotranspiration). We use both traditional clustering approaches and Empirical Orthogonal Function analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the system. Additional field measurements are then taken to better represent key clusters of similar soil moisture dynamics and contribute to analysis of space-time soil moisture dynamics under a warming climate.",2010,2012

The questions were generated by an open inclusive process that included personal interviews with decision makers broad solicitation of research needs from scientists and policymakers and an intensive workshop that included more than 30 scientifically oriented individuals responsible for managing and developing policy related to natural resources. The process differed from previous efforts to set priorities for conservation research in its focus on the engagement of decision- makers in addition to researchers. The research priorities emphasized the policy relevance of addressing societal context exploration of trade-offs among alternative policies and actions and more-traditional questions related to ecological processes and functions. We then conducted a survey of natural resource policymakers managers and scientists to rank the research questions with respect to their applicability to policy. We received completed surveys from 602 respondents including 194 policymakers and 70 scientists from government 228 scientists from academia and 110 others. A question on water supply necessary to sustain human populations and ecosystem resilience was ranked as having the greatest potential to increase the effectiveness of policies related to management of natural resources in the United States. There were significant differences in research priorities among respondents. We did not however find differences in priorities between academics and government employees nor between academic and government scientists and policymakers.

Rapid Cenozoic convergence within the Tien Shan of Kyrgyzstan has produced clear evidence for episodic shifting of the loci of faulting from the bedrock-bounded margins of sedimentary basins to their interiors. This observation is consistent with predictions of analogue and numerical models in which active deformation is modulated by erosion or addition of topographic loads [Harris et al. 1995; Simpson 2004; Tucker and Slingerland 1996; Turpeinen et al. 2008]. Analogue models predict that removal of mass from hanging walls by erosion and addition of mass to footwalls by sedimentation serve to retard the formation of new faults within a basin [Hoth et al. 2006]. Numerical models similarly predict that erosion above a fault can promote fault activity by decreasing the normal stress across the fault [Hilley et al. 2005; Simpson 2006]. Other numerical studies indicate that without removal of sedimentary fill by river networks closed basins can persist with little internal deformation for long periods of time [Sobel 2003]. We propose to address some of the key controls on changes in patterns of deformation within actively deforming contractional ranges. We pose the following questions: Under what conditions do former intermontane basins become sites of active localized deformation? When deformation migrates from the basin margin to its interior are the new faults juvenile structures that rupture the underlying basement or are they low-angle structures such as decollements that are linked to the basin marginal faults? When a basin narrows as basin-bounding thrusts impinge across its margins do rates of shortening decrease and does the loci of deformation shift into other basins? We hypothesize that migration of deformation into former depocenters is modulated by erosional evacuation and unloading of basins and that as a basin is zippered closed by thrusts the loads of the marginal ranges decrease the magnitude of deformation within the basin itself.,2009,2011

Prior studies of surface waters in this creek have focused on quantifying culturable fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) but FIB are neither specific to fecal material nor specific to human waste and thus cannot be used for definitively determining if human fecal material is a contributing factor to microbiological water quality. The Holden Lab at UCSB was contacted by representatives of the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Indians (SYBCI) and solicited to perform this research.

The tracers to be tested are boron‚Äì10 (as 10B enriched borate) and radio-sulfur (35S). Multi-tracer experiments with SF6 10B and 35S will be conducted on a variety of scales ranging from laboratory columns (travel time of minutes) to MAR operations (travel time of months) to evaluate the relative performance of the different tracers. The proposed study will address issues critical to the operation and regulation of many water reuse projects in California the United States and elsewhere around the world and will increase the available tools for evaluating travel times and hydraulic connections near MAR operations. These data are critical for understanding water quality changes that occur in the subsurface and permitting (in California). The California Air Resources Board (CARB) is in the process of regulating emission of SF6. Although an exemption for research is being discussed and will probably be included the rules will require new methods for the introduction of SF6 into the recharge water that minimize its loss to the atmosphere. Furthermore the EPA has recently determined that SF6 and other greenhouse gases such as CO2 are pollutants. Future federal regulations may supersede California‚Äôs and prevent the use of this tracer at MAR locations.,2010,2014

The Tongass National Forest (southeast Alaska USA) and the Great Bear Rainforest (British Columbia Canada) collectively represent Earth‚Äôs largest coastal temperate rainforest. To date conservation science in each region largely has evolved independently. In part that separation reflects differences between countries in governance and social priorities. However the professional conservation community has not explored fully whether collaboration among those conducting or applying science in the Tongass National Forest and Great Bear Rainforest might increase the probability of achieving conservation objectives across the ecosystem as a whole. We propose to convene a scoping workshop of approximately 25 experts in the ecology and conservation of coastal temperate rainforests transboundary conservation and conservation area design. The group will begin to frame an agenda for using existing and new understanding from the natural physical and social sciences to sustain conservation outcomes for coastal temperate rainforest in a period of rapid environmental and societal change.,2009,2010

In the United States such models are relevant to federally mandated management of wild animals by state-level agencies. We sampled birds during the breeding seasons of 2001‚Äì2009 with fixed-radius point counts. For each of 50 species we used boosted regression trees to model reporting rate (proportion of years a location was surveyed in which the species was present) as a function of covariates related to topography and current land cover and climate. To assess model fit we calculated the proportion of binomial deviance explained. We used cross-validation to estimate the predictive accuracy of the models. We applied program Zonation which was designed for spatial conservation prioritization to identify the set of cells that maximized summed reporting rates for multiple species through time given current land cover and two scenarios of land-cover change (expansion of pinyon‚Äìjuniper woodland and contraction of riparian woodland). Models based on the set of 13 covariates derived from remotely sensed data had some predictive capacity for 41 of 50 species. Models suggested little change in the spatial distribution of high-quality habitat for these species following projected expansion of pinyon‚Äìjuniper woodland. There were considerable differences among species with respect to variables that explained a high proportion of variation in reporting rates and in projected responses to different scenarios of land-cover change.,2009,2013

612p,Jordan Clark,7/1/08,6/30/10,59487,UC Center for Water Resources,UC-wide,WR1028,35S The Ideal Tracer of Travel Time Near Mar Operations,In the western United States and other regions where water is limited the efficient management of this vital resource is critical. The projected growth in population combined with uncertainties associated with a changing climate is producing unprecedented stresses on water supply systems already stretched to their limits. In addition to conservation new solutions are needed to meet the future water demands in these areas. Managed aquifer recharge (MAR) is a recent advancement in groundwater/surface water management aimed at augmenting water supplies. This practice consists of recharging imported surplus runoff and reclaimed (recycled) wastewater into aquifers for storage and later extraction. Because reclaimed water is low quality and likely to become a larger portion of recharge water in the near future it is of the utmost importance to understand the fate and transport of potential contaminants introduced into the aquifer so that appropriate and cost-effective regulations can be developed to ensure a safe potable water supply. In California draft regulations specify that groundwater supply wells must be more than 150 m (500 ft) from MAR facilities unless the water agency can document with a tracer experiment that the travel time is greater than six months. These rules demonstrate the importance of direct methods for determining travel times over the period of days to a year near MAR operations. The goal of the project is to examine the feasibility of using radio-sulfur 35S as a groundwater dating tool. The advantages of this tracer include: 1) with a half life of 87.4 days this radioactive clock is best suited for determining travel times of weeks to one year the appropriate time scale for MAR operations 2) it is naturally occurs in the environment and thus it is recharged continuously with the source water and 3) this tracer should image preferential flow paths in recharge areas. Because 35S is naturally occurring there is no cost associated with ‚Äútagging‚Äù the source water nor is there the need to have regulatory approval. Results from 35S should be comparable to deliberate tracer experiments such as those pioneered by the PI using dissolved gas tracers. The disadvantage of 35S is that the natural cosmogenic production rate is very low. 35S enters the water cycle as dissolved SO4 and because the mean life of continental SO4 is longer than the half life atmospheric SO4 rich in 35S is diluted in continental waters with 35S-dead SO4. We anticipate that 35S will be delivered to MAR operations primarily in surplus runoff which contains recent precipitation. Reclaimed and imported water should have relatively lower 35S activities because their relatively long transit and storage time allows for the loss of 35S by radioactive decay. Therefore this new tracer method may be best suited for studies of travel times at MAR operations that recharge surplus or storm runoff. The new methodology developed as part of this project will be tested at two large MAR operations in Southern California - the El Rio (Ventura County) and Montebello (LA) spreading grounds. These are ideal areas to test this method because at least 50% of the recharge water is derived from recent runoff and therefore the 35S activity should be relatively high.,2008,2010

The faculty team will conduct collaborative research across the following themes: (1) Human and ecosystem benefits of biofilters (UCLA lead); (2) Microbial communities in biofilter sediments in relationship to nutrient and pathogen removal (UCSB lead); (3) Biofilter removal of metals and nanoparticles (UCR lead); (4) Multi-physics modeling of biofilter water budgets and treatment performance (UCI lead); (5) Tailoring biofilter hydraulics to minimize urban flood risk (UCI lead); (6) Ecosystem and human co-benefit modeling plus coordinating field sampling across five UC campuses (UCI lead); (7) Cost-benefit analyses to uncover the true value of biofilters (relative to conventional stormwater management approaches) and evaluating the effectiveness of existing economic tools to incentivize their adoption (UCSD lead); and (8) Institutional and governance barriers to biofilter adoption (UCI lead). A citizen science component to facilitate technology information transfer beyond the borders of UC campuses will be led out of UCLA. Because the six campuses will be utilized as experimental test beds our project will inform UCs aggressive systemwide water-saving goals and leverage UCs goal of aligning research and academics with campus operations in a functional ‘living laboratory. This multi-campus UC program will solve through interdisciplinary research and education the biophysical and social barriers that currently limit the capture treatment and reuse of urban runoff in Southern California. The center will focus on natural treatment systems such as biofilters (also known as rainwater gardens) that simultaneously augment municipal water supply and provide myriad co-benefits including: receiving water quality and ecosystem protection flood mitigation urban heat island mitigation carbon sequestration urban green space creation and local community engagement. Our center will be unique in its tailoring of sustainable runoff harvesting and reuse to southern Californias semi-arid climate and it will leverage a multi-million dollar NSF-funded Partnerships for International Research and Education (PIRE) project that supports an evaluation of natural treatment systems implemented in Melbourne (Australia) during their decade long Millennium Drought. ,2017,2019

This rights-based approach can be more effective than traditional regulation. Rights-based management helps California meet environmental goals in innovative ways and joint legal/economics analysis of such approaches places the University of California at the forefront of new environmental approaches. Establishing property rights is necessary for markets that create incentives and facilitate transactions to enhance resource value and provide environmental quality. Examples are individual transferable quotas in fisheries tradable development rights and mitigation banks in land use habitat credits for endangered species water rights and water quality trading and conservation banking for ecosystem protection. Knowledge of how these rights must be structured and how the resulting markets function to achieve environmental and other goals is incomplete. Comprehensive empirical research requires information bases that have not been assembled. We propose a Planning Award for this research infrastructure through efforts by scholars in economics and law and to make it available to the UC System and California. Legal scholarship is needed for understanding which aspects of property rights enable transactions for showing how legal institutions affect creation of property rights and for identifying how uncertainty monitoring problems and asymmetric information are addressed. Economics scholarship is needed to understand how property rights affect incentives resource use and social value. This project consists of economists and law faculty in the UC System. This Planning Award project has the goal of defining research agendas and assembling data bases on property rights and market transactions to solve environmental problems. These databases would include registries of transactions for use rights associated with fisheries water and land. Ultimately we will use the data assembled by the Planning Award for drafting a Program Award for collaborative efforts in empirical research aimed at understanding why property rights can be used in some situations but not in others and why markets arise easily and function smoothly in some environmental resource settings but not for others. California policy questions motivate the databases compiled including over-exploitation of fisheries inefficiencies in water use conservation of endangered species and ecosystem protection. ,2015,2017

625p,Hunter Lenihan,7/1/10,6/30/11,1512,UC Sea Grant College Program,UC-wide,20101258,MPA-Based Collaborative Techniques to Improve Management of Nearshore Fisheries,Spatially structured data poor stocks are among the most valuable fisheries in California. Effective management of these stocks is suboptimal due to the lack of stock status indicators and unknown quantitative reference points. Stock assessments are the basic framework for computing stock status indicators yet many nearshore species lack the necessary data to perform traditional stock assessments. Moreover many stocks in the nearshore environment are governed by metapopulation dynamics (Gunderson et al. 2006) in which discrete populations are connected via larval dispersal (Kritzer and Sale 2004). For these species traditional coast-wide assessments are insufficient to account for differences in mortality rates growth rates reproductive patterns and harvest pressure between sub populations (Francis et al. 2008) thus reducing the potential to set harvest levels at predetermined target levels. The spiny lobster (Panulirus interruptus) is an economically culturally and ecologically important species in California. During the 2007-‚Äô08 fishing season for example 167 active commercial permits landed 306t (metric) with an ex- vessel value of ~$7.22 million. A vigorous recreational fishery is also formed around this species and initial analyses of recreational report cards issued by the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) suggest that this sector contributes significantly to the total catch. In December of 2009 the authors participated in a workshop convened by CDFG that outlined needs and objectives for completion of a stock assessment by December 2010. Stock assessment biologists and independent consultants (Marine Stewardship Council) have determined that estimates of fishing mortality natural mortality and growth rates are critical to performing a robust assessment of the spiny lobster resource. California‚Äôs nearshore finfish fishery targets multiple species using hook-and-line and trap gear. Although the total statewide volume of commercial landings in the nearshore groundfish fishery has been modest in recent years (224 tons landed commercially in California waters in 2006) many of theA(and net revenues of $2.2 million in 2006). Grass rockfish (Sebastes rastrelliger) is one of the predominantly landed stocks of the 19 species managed under the Nearshore Fisheries Management Plan (Nearshore FMP 2002). Sufficient data to evaluate stock status of grass rockfish and a majority of the other species in the Nearshore FMP are unavailable and therefore the complex is managed using the precautionary approach (Restrepo et al. 1998). The Reauthorization of the Magnuson Act now requires the setting of Annual Catch Limits (ACLs) for all US fisheries. To effectively set ACLs novel methods must be developed and utilized for these data poor species. The implementation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) along the California coast (MLPA) offers tremendous potential for managers to use these zones to guide decision making at local scales. No-take MPAs may serve as proxies for unfished populations at specific locations. By comparing MPAs to adjacent fished areas that experience similar environmental conditions it may be possible to calculate natural mortality and fishing mortality rates as well as design methods that set sustainable harvest levels at local scales. We have developed two novel methods for utilizing data from MPAs to inform fisheries management decisions for the nearshore and spiny lobster fisheries: (1) A decision tree model (Wilson et al. 2010) that can be used to set ACLs and (2) a length structured model that uses growth models and size structure data from inside and outside reserves to calculate rates of natural and fishery- imposed mortality. For spiny lobster the growth and mortality models developed in this proposal and the resulting outputs will be directly utilized in the upcoming stock assessment being performed by Doug Neilson of CDFG.

626p,Hunter Lenihan,7/1/10,6/30/11,33288,UC Sea Grant College Program,UC-wide,R/FISH-213EPD-TR,MPA-Based Collaborative Techniques to Improve Management of Nearshore Fisheries,Spatially structured data poor stocks are among the most valuable fisheries in California. Effective management of these stocks is suboptimal due to the lack of stock status indicators and unknown quantitative reference points. Stock assessments are the basic framework for computing stock status indicators yet many nearshore species lack the necessary data to perform traditional stock assessments. Moreover many stocks in the nearshore environment are governed by metapopulation dynamics (Gunderson et al. 2006) in which discrete populations are connected via larval dispersal (Kritzer and Sale 2004). For these species traditional coast-wide assessments are insufficient to account for differences in mortality rates growth rates reproductive patterns and harvest pressure between sub populations (Francis et al. 2008) thus reducing the potential to set harvest levels at predetermined target levels. The spiny lobster (Panulirus interruptus) is an economically culturally and ecologically important species in California. During the 2007-‚Äô08 fishing season for example 167 active commercial permits landed 306t (metric) with an ex- vessel value of ~$7.22 million. A vigorous recreational fishery is also formed around this species and initial analyses of recreational report cards issued by the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) suggest that this sector contributes significantly to the total catch. In December of 2009 the authors participated in a workshop convened by CDFG that outlined needs and objectives for completion of a stock assessment by December 2010. Stock assessment biologists and independent consultants (Marine Stewardship Council) have determined that estimates of fishing mortality natural mortality and growth rates are critical to performing a robust assessment of the spiny lobster resource. California‚Äôs nearshore finfish fishery targets multiple species using hook-and-line and trap gear. Although the total statewide volume of commercial landings in the nearshore groundfish fishery has been modest in recent years (224 tons landed commercially in California waters in 2006) many of theA(and net revenues of $2.2 million in 2006). Grass rockfish (Sebastes rastrelliger) is one of the predominantly landed stocks of the 19 species managed under the Nearshore Fisheries Management Plan (Nearshore FMP 2002). Sufficient data to evaluate stock status of grass rockfish and a majority of the other species in the Nearshore FMP are unavailable and therefore the complex is managed using the precautionary approach (Restrepo et al. 1998). The Reauthorization of the Magnuson Act now requires the setting of Annual Catch Limits (ACLs) for all US fisheries. To effectively set ACLs novel methods must be developed and utilized for these data poor species. The implementation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) along the California coast (MLPA) offers tremendous potential for managers to use these zones to guide decision making at local scales. No-take MPAs may serve as proxies for unfished populations at specific locations. By comparing MPAs to adjacent fished areas that experience similar environmental conditions it may be possible to calculate natural mortality and fishing mortality rates as well as design methods that set sustainable harvest levels at local scales. We have developed two novel methods for utilizing data from MPAs to inform fisheries management decisions for the nearshore and spiny lobster fisheries: (1) A decision tree model (Wilson et al. 2010) that can be used to set ACLs and (2) a length structured model that uses growth models and size structure data from inside and outside reserves to calculate rates of natural and fishery- imposed mortality. For spiny lobster the growth and mortality models developed in this proposal and the resulting outputs will be directly utilized in the upcoming stock assessment being performed by Doug Neilson of CDFG. We are in direct contact with Dr. Neilson and he has expressed a need for these data as soon as possible thus the urgency of this research is immediate. The decision tree-ACL model developed in this proposal and the recommended harvest levels for grass rockfish will be published in peer reviewed journals with the expectation of becoming a tool in the CDFG and NOAA Fisheries toolbox for setting ACLs which is also of immediate urgency.

The aim of this project is to develop a pair of interlocking dynamic models and field analyses to quantify the availability and distribution of stream temperature dissolved oxygen and sediment conditions that support Chinook populations. This will be done by coupling an existing hydrodynamic model with an existing stream network population model to 1) perturb existing flow releases from the Friant Dam (timing frequency magnitude duration rate of change) 2) advance our understanding of habitat suitability across gradients of temperature and dissolved oxygen 3) predict fish population response to direct and interactive flow/habitat disturbances and 5) identify critical cause and effect pathways to defining a restored ecosystem for Chinook salmon throughout the Bay Delta. Doing so gives rise to emergent complex dynamics that can be examined only through an integrated study of flow abiotic effects and fish populations. Each of these has a potentially unique spatial signature that is in part controlled by hydrograph manipulation and fish will thrive only where all of these coincide. Planning for flow releases in Bay Delta systems may be better informed if we understand the abiotic and ecological significance.,2011,2013

We will first quantify bedform-flux interactions using high-resolution derived terrain discharge information measured at multiple gauging sites and climate information in distinct bar-bend reaches. This high-resolution data will also be used to inform and evaluate a two-dimensional subsurface hydrologic model in channel bedforms where the spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity is measured in situ. Our goal is to investigate the effects of bar morphology patterns of streambed hydraulic conductivity and the physical parameters controlling bedform morphology on the hyporheic flow. We will document their influence on patterns of subsurface flow and quantify physically based adjustments on the magnitude and extent of infiltration and seepage intragravel flow velocity the residence time distribution and the mean hyporheic depth. We quantify and compare these physical measures for a natural engineered and flow-modified river reach at spatial and temporal scales critical to Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) early life stages. ,2014,2015

A major impact of climate change with rising sea levels is increased coastal erosion of beaches and sea cliffs. Billions of dollars of property are at increased risk if coastal erosion accelerates (Ryan et al. 1999). The last powerful El Niño in 1998 raised local sea levels in Central California by as much as 20-30 cm (Huyer et al. 2002). This rise is equivalent to the projected sea-level rise in Central California near the end of the 21st century (Cayan et al. 2008 2009; NRC 2012). The 2015-16 El Niño is shaping up to be a very strong event that will likely bring higher sea levels in California. Tidal records in Santa Barbara suggest that it has already risen about 15 cm as of mid-October 2015. Mean sea level rise for Santa Barbara in recent decades is 0.73 ± 1.2 mm/yr (NOAA 2015). For Southern California considering tectonic processes the rate is 1.5 to 2.4 mm/yr (Reynolds and Simms 2015). Projected global rise in sea level is 18-48 cm by 2050 (Board of Earth Sciences and Resources 2015). The purpose of the proposed research is to quantify the extent of coastal change in beaches and sea cliffs as a result of both the expected El Niño storms during the winter of 2015- 2016 and the rise in sea level as a result of El Niño. We intend to use a combination of existing 2006 and 2009-2011 high-resolution airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) as well as new terrestrial LiDAR data which we will obtain from equipment available at the University of California Santa Barbara. Higher waves and sea levels will increase rates of coastal erosion along beaches and sea cliffs (Sallenger et al 1998; Komar 1998). However very little work has quantified these changes over a particular time period and at particular places. The 2015-2016 period provides a unique opportunity to observe changes attributable to higher sea levels and perhaps to more intense storms with higher waves. These may then be compared with existing 2006 and 2009- 2011 LiDAR airborne results to visualize and measure changes (Rosser et al. 2005; Young et al. 2006). The research will continue after the El Niño into 2016 to determine if erosion rates return to pre-El Niño values. ,2016,2016

For California this interest provides an opportunity both to help achieve GHG reduction targets as well as boosting economic opportunities for farmers. Potential impacts on habitat and biodiversity however have been largely neglected in the dialog in California and globally. Impacts could be substantial (though not necessarily negative) at the level of production needed to significantly supplant fossil fuels. In fact some energy crops such as perennial grasses have the potential to restore degraded agricultural landscapes and improve its habitat value for imperiled species. We propose to address this Environmental Issue in Energy Supply and Use through an investigation of the potential of biofuel feedstock production for habitat improvement in the southern San Joaquin Valley. We are beginning a research program to develop a formal assessment tool based on Life Cycle Assessment. This tool will be capable of evaluating the suite of environmental impacts of biofuel production and use among feedstock sources. Developing an impact indicator for biodiversity and associated (characterization) models are critical requirements of that larger program. For this proposed project we will begin to define such an indicator and develop the associated models of impact for energy crops suitable for the study area in California‚Äôs San Joaquin Valley. For this project we propose to use a combination of expert opinion of habitat quality in relation to levels and configuration of energy crops with GIS spatial analysis.,2007,2009

633p,Arturo Keller,10/1/08,9/30/09,13000,University of California,UC-wide,SB090033,Role of NOM on Fate and Transport of Nanoparticles Under Varying Solution Chemistry,Increasing concern about the potential toxicological impacts of nanomaterials gives rise requires a thorough understanding of their environmental fate and transport mechanisms (e.g. Wiesner et. al. 2006 Poland et al. 2008). Nanoparticles (NPs) are likely to demonstrate unique environmental behavior due to their larger surface/volume ratio high surface activity and quantum confinement effects. Many NPs are soluble in water. Even for insoluble NPs they may be functionalized to increase their affinity for the aqueous phase. Thus the aqueous phase is an important pathway for NPs. Natural organic matter (NOM) is the decomposition product of biota consisting of polyelectrolytes with varying molecular sizes (Hyung and Kim 2008). Ionization of carboxylic and phenolic moieties make NOM negatively charged. In the aqueous phase the ubiquitous NOM may bind with NPs and influence the dispersability stability and mobility of NOM-NP complexes. Recent studies have reported on the stabilization of carbon nanotubes in the presence of NOM (e.g. Hyung et. al. 2007; Wang et al. 2008). Also the hindrance and facilitation effects of NOM on fullerene (C60) aggregation at different ionic strengths have also been reported (Chen and Elimelech 2007). This research project aims to study the effect of NOM and humic acid (HA) on NP aggregation and attachment processes and the underlying interaction mechanisms in different water matrices. In addition key solution chemistry parameters such as pH ionic strength (IS) and the ratio of monovalent/divalent cations will be considered. Preliminary results from our lab show that ZnO can be stabilized by NOM in aqueous systems (Table 1 in Appendix); also NOM-ZnO complexes exhibit opposing effects with regards to aggregation under different IS and pH conditions (Tables 2 and 3 in Appendix). The hypotheses to be tested in this project include: (1) the surface charge of NPs and the electrostatic interaction between NPs will be changed after binding with NOM; (2) NOM will improve the aqueous stability of hydrophobic NPs by increasing their surface hydrophilicity; (3) NOM will facilitate the partial disaggregation of NPs at low IS and assist in the aggregation of NPs at high IS. (4) NOM will decrease the attachment efficiency of NPs to natural particles by enhancing the electrostatic repulsion force between NP and natural particles since most natural particles are also negatively charged. We expect that this will result in increased mobility of NOM-NP complexes.,2008,2009

Fifteen percent of the global nanotechnology industry is resident to California. Production of CdSe quantum dots (QDs) a class of nano-sized semiconductors is forecasted to increase exponentially. Thus environmental and biological exposure to QDs can be expected to increase proportionally. Little is known about the transport and toxicity of quantum dots. Preliminary toxicity research of QDs have demonstrated toxic and mutagenic responses in biological systems. The objectives of this research are to: elucidate transport behaviors of QDs obtain microbial toxicological data from a partner lab engaged in QD research conduct a baseline risk assessment and to develop policy recommendations. Batch experiments will be conducted in which the kinetics stability and aggregation behavior of QDs in aqueous solution will be studied. The kinetics stability and aggregation behavior of QDs will also be studied with natural aqueous matrices. This study will utilize an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) to characterize the shape and level of aggregation of QDs in aqueous samples. Transport investigations will be accomplished by conducting column experiments. The risk assessment will be conducted in accordance with EPA procedures and guided by recent developments in nanoscale risk assessment.

How these changes will impact the state depend on multiple factors including climate change impacts within the state changes in timber prices due to climate change and impacts of land use change on private timber lands. This study will incorporate a multi- faceted biological and economic model to capture the most important drivers of this change. The methods used in this study will build on the approach taken by Mendelsohn (2003) with improvements through incorporating information from multiple biological models particularly a species-based model of biological effects of climate change. We will use estimates of land use change available within the biological model to improve on the previous assumption of no changes in land use. Both public and private timberlands will be encompassed in the study. The biological model will generate information on species composition at a site with volume being estimated from age class and net primary productivity. The economic model takes this information and develops estimates of economic change in a multi-stepped process. First timber harvests and net revenues are calculated under a baseline case of no climate change as a reference. In the baseline case we assume that forest productivity in each region of the state will remain constant. In calculating the impact of climate change on timber markets we look at species with the highest timber value and volume across private and public timberlands as reported by the State Board of Equalization and other sources. These include ponderosa pine hemlock and fir and miscellaneous conifer. Where multiple species are aggregated under a general name other sources will be used to estimate actual contribution of individual biological species. We then calculate average productivity of each species in each county by dividing harvests by acreage and use those yield functions to estimate a rotation age for each species using timber harvest and value statistics also provided by the State.,2008,2010
636p,Arturo Keller,10/1/09,6/30/10,10000,University of California,UC-wide,SB100031,UV Irradiation of Nanoparticles in Natural Water Systems,Very little is known about the environmental chemistry of nanomaterials (NMs). The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the quenching of ROS are two important reactions in natural aqueous systems where NMs may have an impact 1 2. The potential increased generation of ROS by photoactivated nanomaterials as well as being highly reactive can more readily degrade planktonic algae and other important organics thus influencing the productivity of an ecosystem 3. Increased ROS generation can also more efficiently render labile dissolved organic matter (DOM) into mineralized CO2. The increased recalcitrance of DOM may decrease microbial degradation rates of DOM and can potentially decrease the productivity of an ecosystem 4. Additionally the increased concentration of ROS can potentially lead to increased interactions of radicals with the biota. Electron transfer quenching by nanomaterials is also an important reaction. During electron-hole pair recombination some nanomaterials can scavenge an electron and thus decrease the natural ROS generation. The objective is to investigate the ability of nanosize metal oxides to increase or quench the generation of ROS in simulated freshwater and seawater systems. The ROS production and quenching kinetics will be investigated using a xenon arc lamp to irradiate a photoreactor.,2009,2010
637p,Arturo Keller,10/1/09,6/30/10,10000,University of California,UC-wide,SB100032,Role of Material Properties on the Aggregation of Nanoparticles in Natural Waters. Introduction,The potential toxicity of emerging nanomaterials has drawn significant attention in the past few years. Investigations have shown various negative effects of nanomaterials to plants phytoplankton mammals and even human cell lines (Xia 2008; Franklin 2007; Lin 2008;). To fully assess the environmental risk of nanomaterials the information of how these materials transport and transform and in which forms these materials reach organisms and cause negative effects is indispensable. In the aqueous environment nanoparticles (NPs) tend to attract each other and form aggregates (Chen and Elimelech 2006). This process influences the mobility of NPs and determines their final sink. In the current effort of the UC CEIN in investigating nanomaterials‚Äô environmental impact understanding how nanoparticles aggregate is key for the toxicological assessment. This information helps IRGs2 and 3 to predict in which form and at what particle size will nanoparticles be present in their mesocosm waters. Such knowledge is also indispensable for the multi-media modeling endeavor of IRG 6. The first year of this project focused on understanding the role of solution chemistry on NPs‚Äô aggregation. It is seen that pH and ionic strength both influence NPs‚Äô aggregation by manipulating particles‚Äô surface charge and that the concentration of NP changes the aggregation rate by altering the collision rate. In addition natural organic matters (NOM) have been shown to stabilize NPs by increasing the electrostatic repulsion between particles. These results have been verified by our studies with natural waters from IRG 2 and 3. In addition to solution chemistry NP aggregation is controlled by material properties. For instance the surface charge of nanoparticles may vary with size due to the change in low- coordination number sites at surface edges and steps (Guzman 2006). Particle size crystal structure surface coating and doping all have impacts on NP aggregation (Klane 2008). Therefore in the second year of this project I propose to study the role of material properties on NP aggregation. Specifically the following hypotheses will be tested: (1) traditional DLVO theory (take electric double layer repulsion and van der Waals attraction into account) is not sufficient to describe the aggregation mechanism (Guzman 2006) hydrophobic hydration and/or Born interaction may be involved in NP aggregation; (2) primary particle size of NP may play a role in aggregation by influencing point of zero charge (PZC) the abundance of surface functional groups as well as aggregate fractal dimension; (3) differences in crystal structure for a given material may lead to distinct aggregation kinetics; (4) morphology of nanoparticles may shape their aggregation process.,2009,2010

However our understanding fecal pollution in coastal ecosystems as well as our ability to identify and mitigate its sources is greatly limited by the uncertainties surrounding its behavior in two major reservoirs: wetlands and beach sediments. Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) and pathogens can enter coastal creeks and rivers from upland sources but near-shore beach sources are also significant reservoirs and coastal wetlands have been shown to both increase and decrease the levels of FIB in water. This field and laboratory based study was developed as an examination and assessment of sources levels and pathways of pathogens in coastal wetlands and sediments a priority research area. The research had two core focus areas. The first focus area involved conducting field surveys in tandem with laboratory analysis for human specific markers in four coastal wetlands and beaches. The second focus area was a laboratory based systematic investigation of factors contributing to pathogen and pathogen indicator transport and fate in sediments. This research was multi-institutional involving UCR UCLA and UCSB. UCSB performed primary field and laboratory research at the Carpinteria Salt Marsh Reserve in support of the first focus area. UCLA was a collaborating institution. Field sampling was designed to determine the origins of fecal indicator bacteria the presence of human waste markers and spatiotemporal patterns relative to tidal influences. Human waste markers were discovered and tidal stage was related to fecal indicator bacterial levels. Data analysis is ongoing in support of preparing a manuscript for peer review.,2008,2010

While climate change is a global phenomenon, climate change impacts will be region specific. In Southwest US, climate change is predicted to lead to increases in droughts, increases in heat waves and decreases in snowpack. These changes are expected to have profound consequences on water management practices in the Southwest. We propose to develop a method of assessing the vulnerability of water supply at the scale of a municipal watershed with the expectation that our results will be immediately useful to both the scientific community and water managers. Our approach will address several key scientific challenges that arise in assessing climate change impacts at local watershed scales. Specifically we will explicitly consider coupled eco-hydrologic responses to climate change, including the impact of drought on vegetation water use through plant physiologic responses and indirectly through fire and disease. We will also assess different approaches for downscaling climate model scenarios to local watershed scales and quantify the sensitivity of model predictions to downscaling approaches.

More detailed, process-based distributed hydrologic models may produce different hydrological responses to climate change, especially with their more detailed representation of groundwater recharge.

The Department of Seismology at the IGF (Institute of Geophysics) at UNAM (Universidad Nacional Autonoma de exico) is now coordinating a project to prepare for the scientific response to such an earthquake. The scientific response includes estimating the parameters of the earthquake such as the location orientation and size of the fault plane the magnitude and pattern of slip the possible effects of the earthquakes as well as the response to measure aftershocks. Currently the researchers at UNAM do not have access to tools that could integrate all the available (synthetic) data sets to estimate the slip on the fault plane.

644p,Ralph Archuleta,11/1/10,10/31/12,60000,University of California,UC-wide,20110295,Peer NGA-EAST Finite Fault Simulations,We propose to compute ground motions from a kinematic source description that is based on correlated random distributions for the slip amplitude rupture velocity peak time (time of maximum sliprate) and rise time (duration of sliprate) on the fault (Schmedes et al. 2009). The distributions are determined from dynamic ruptures as are the correlations between slip amplitude rupture velocity and rise time (Schmedes et al. 2009). The method of using correlated random source parameters based on the work of Liu et al. (2006) is very flexible and can be easily modified to adjust to our evolving understanding of earthquake ruptures. This kinematic approach is similar then the one proposed by Liu et al. (2006) but instead of creating separate normal distributed fields as a starting point we propose to use a 4-dimensional Gauss distribution that is constructed using the covariance matrix of the normal score transformed parameters slip rise time peak time and rupture velocity. To account for the effect of scattering on the high frequency radiation pattern a frequency-dependent perturbation of azimuth dip and rake of each subfault is implemented similar to Pitarka et al. (2000). The complexity of the source process is represented by spatial distributions of randomized source parameters but the integrated characteristics of these parameters are constrained by the total seismic moment radiated energy and the high-frequency decay of the spectral amplitudes in the source spectrum. The ground motions can be computed in either a 1D (horizontally layered) or 3D viscoelastic structure. If a 3D structure is used only the low frequencies (f < ~1-2 Hz) are computed for that structure. A 1D structure with travel times consistent with the 3D structure is used for high frequencies. It needs to be emphasized that this method is not meant to give a single ground motion at a given station; it is meant to give a range of ground motions. We do not know the exact description of faulting for a future earthquake. We only know ‚Äîstatistically‚Äî the properties of past earthquakes. These properties are what we use in conjunction with the representation theorem and wave propagation to predict the range of ground motion at a given station or stations for a specified earthquake. We have validated this method against data from the Northridge and Loma Prieta earthquakes. We have also compared with Landers but have not incorporated a multi-segmented fault which is a much closer approximation to the actual rupture. The proposed method has already been implemented on the SCEC/USGS Broadband Platform.,2010,2012

These mineral deposits formed in one of the largest supervolcano fields in Earth history. Recent improvement in access in part due to a new gold rush makes it possible to produce the first geologic maps of a large sector of this province and date the volcanic and intrusive rocks. This will allow us to understand the eruptive processes and feeder types that may be unique to supervolcanoes and to determine the conditions that give birth to them. The SMO supervolcano field represents Earth‚Äôs most well preserved silicic large igneous province; there high-silica magmas were repeatedly erupted in extremely large volumes (>1000 cubic kilometers) through highly explosive eruptions. Magmatism in the SMO represents the precursor of lithospheric rupture that eventually led to the formation of the Gulf of California. This project will allow us to carry out frontier research in this important province by making mugeologic maps and obtaining the first age dates on a large region.,2009,2012

The wave measurements have a spatial resolution nearly 100 times better than other similar data in the literature (e.g. Romero and Melville, 2010). This will allow testing and improving the numerical wind-wave predictions a across multiple scales (100m to 30cm).

For intraslab events which are dominated by normal fault events we will use magnitude stress parameter and nodal plane as three basic parameters. We will investigate the following three questions: 1) In modeling the intermediate earthquakes do we need abnormal high/low stress parameter? 2) Is there a significant radiation difference between rupture on sub-horizontal fault plane and rupture on a sub-vertical fault plane? (Up-dip directivity) 3) Will the GMPEs show a break in scaling of PGA and PGV at some large magnitude? There are known width limitations:  Subducted oceanic crust ~10 km.  Plate unbending model: neutral plane ~ half of slab width: 15-30 km given limits on the width.  Slab width is strongly dependent on the age of the subducted plate: width is about 30 km for a young subduction zone like Cascadia and about 50-60 km for an old subduction zone Japan trench. If the earthquakes occur on a reactivated outer-rise fault (~ 45o relative to slab interface) the corresponding critical widths are 14 21-42 42-84 km depending on the age of the subducted slab. ,2017,2017
655p,Toshiro Tanimoto,7/1/15,12/31/17,15037,University of California,UC-wide,SB160023,Monitoring Hurricanes by the US and Mexican Seismic Networks,Developing a new approach for monitoring hurricanes would be useful for mitigating hurricane hazards in the US and Mexico. We propose to develop a new seismic approach for the dual purpose of (i) improving our understanding of the hurricane dynamics and (ii) developing a new monitoring methodology for predicting the intensity of incoming hurricanes so that warning may be issued. This new seismological approach will utilize seismic networks that have become available in the United States and Mexico in the last 10 years now allow us to monitor hurricanes from seismic ground motions. The intensification of hurricanes is associated with strong pressure changes at the Earths surface that in turn lead to larger excitation of seismic ground motions. While progress by aircraft radar and satellite observations in the atmospheric sciences has brought great progress to our understanding of hurricanes in the last 50 years these seismic data will provide a fresh new perspective because continuous streams of seismic data provide completely different views of a hurricane views from the ground. The first goal of this project is to improve our understanding of the hurricane dynamics. The second goal is to develop a practical scheme to monitor the intensification of hurricanes by seismic data. This is useful for hazard mitigation especially if the intensity changes can be monitored remotely while a hurricane is still in the ocean.We have done this line of work using seismic data only from the US so far. Addition of seismic data from the Mexican National Seismic Network will broaden the area of this study and is advantageous as some hurricanes hit Mexico before reaching the US. Our primary motivation for this project is the addition of the Mexican National Seismic Network data to the analysis and focus on studying hurricanes that pass through Mexico. We expect that there will be many features that we were not able to discover only with the US data. ,2015,2017

The reconstructed data has a low bias which is improvedby using the blended product or can be quickly corrected with the local snow sensor data for the same time period. The State of Californias Department of Water Resources (CA DWR) would like to fully integrate spatial SWE into their water forecasts. Products produced by ERI for this study will be used by water forecasters in the state of California to integrate modeled spatial SWE into their forecasting operations.

660p,Jeff Dozier,9/1/16,8/31/19,120000,University of California,UC-wide,NNX16AO25H,Using the spatial variability of snow accumulation to evaluate the orographic effect in California's Sierra Nevada,California depends greatly on snow accumulation in high altitude watersheds in the Sierra Nevada for its annual water supply. Snowfall is typically generated by the topographic lifting of moist air advected to the region by powerful winter storms. Higher elevations tend to receive more precipitation that the lowland areas due to orographic effects. To capture this spatial variability we currently use a combination of rain gauges and snow pillows. However the paucity of these stations particularly at high elevations makes the estimate of mountain precipitation error prone and hard to assess. This has large implications for the hydrologic modeling of these watersheds and therefore streamflow forecasting. In order to reduce the error around these forecasts we need alternatives to surface stations that can truly capture the spatial patterns of precipitation. Remotely sensed snow depth and water equivalent at a time scale that resolves storms could offer a truly unique answer to this problem. Even though NASAs Airborne Snow Observatorys (ASO) primary mission objective is to measure snow depth and reflectivity for streamflow forecasting it has recorded a number of storms in 2014 and 2015 and will again fly this year. This has presented a truly unique opportunity to study the spatial distribution of snowfall in the Tuolumne basin in Californias Central Sierra Nevada. Therefore I will use ASO to first investigate the spatial structure of precipitation through changes in snow depth and then use these observations to assess whether gridded precipitation products and surface station data can replicate these observed spatial patterns. Finally I will analyze the regional atmospheric circulation patterns for the individual events as this may be key to understanding the differences in snow accumulation between storms. Collection of the ASO data upfront and preliminary testing have demonstrated the feasibility of this study thus minimizing the proposal risk while also indicating the potential for considerable scientific reward. The proposed study directly supports the Water and Energy Cycle focus of NASAs Earth Science Research program and the Water Resources focus area of NASAs Applied Sciences Program. The work will provide valuable insights into to the distribution of water in mountain environments through an innovative and unique blend of NASA remotely sensed observations and models. ,2016,2019

Initially batch treatments will be conducted to determine the removal efficiency of the most abundant contaminants found in the water samples.

A filter will be designed and tested at laboratory scale to demonstrate the suitability of this novel platform for the removal of contaminants of emerging concern from water. This ultimately might lead to the development of large scale engineered filters for the supply of clean water. ,2018,2019

A citizen science component to facilitate technology information transfer beyond the borders of UC campuses will be led out of UCLA. Because the six campuses will be utilized as experimental test beds our project will inform UCs aggressive systemwide water-saving goals and leverage UCs goal of aligning research and academics with campus operations in a functional ‘living laboratory. This multi-campus UC program will solve through interdisciplinary research and education the biophysical and social barriers that currently limit the capture treatment and reuse of urban runoff in Southern California. The center will focus on natural treatment systems such as biofilters (also known as rainwater gardens) that simultaneously augment municipal water supply and provide myriad co-benefits including: receiving water quality and ecosystem protection flood mitigation urban heat island mitigation carbon sequestration urban green space creation and local community engagement. Our center will be unique in its tailoring of sustainable runoff harvesting and reuse to southern Californias semi-arid climate and it will leverage a multi-million dollar NSF-funded Partnerships for International Research and Education (PIRE) project that supports an evaluation of natural treatment systems implemented in Melbourne (Australia) during their decade long Millennium Drought. ,2018,2019

Seismology and acoustics are complementary methods for quantifying volcanic eruption processes. Seismic data form the backbone of most volcano monitoring systems. Seismic signals at erupting volcanoes capture subsurface magma transport and degassing associated with explosive eruptions. Infrasound (acoustic waves with frequencies below 20 Hz) is a newer technology; infrasound data record subaerial degassing and allow physical quantification of explosive eruption mechanisms. Popocatepetl is the most active volcano in Mexico and a prodigious source of explosive activity making it an ideal target to combine seismic and infrasound investigations. We have collected the first continuous infrasound and seismic data ever at Popocatepetl. ,2018,2019

667p,Sangwon Suh,1/1/19,12/31/20,10071,University of California,UC-wide,2019-3702,Maximizing the Environmental Utility of Battery Storage,Building on the previous workshop at UCD this workshop aims to further the discussion on life cycle modeling focusing on consequential approaches. LCA has been used largely as a tool to quantify the environmental impacts of existing technologies based on historical data. The retrospective perspective of conventional LCA exhibits a clear limitation when applied to emerging technologies such as large-scale battery storage. For such technologies understanding their life cycle impacts requires modeling potential changes that the technology in question will introduce to the economy and the environment. In particular the following questions and potential modeling approaches to address them will be discussed during the workshop: (1) The problem of curtailment in high-renewable electricity grid (2) The role of battery storage in mitigating curtailment and peak-shaving (3) Understanding the concept of marginal technologies (4) Modeling approaches to grid-response to large-scale battery storage and (5) Economies of scale and learning effects. For each of the topics relevant background and current literature will be presented followed by each group's brief intervention on the knowledge and data that the group can provide to advance the topic. As consequential modeling requires insights from multiple domains of science it is important for the participants to share their expertise during the workshop. To better facilitate the process the organizer will circulate a pre-workshop packet describing the type of data and knowledge needed to operationalize consequential modeling. ,2019,2020
