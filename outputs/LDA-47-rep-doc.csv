Precipitation data are obtained from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) in pentads during 23 austral summers (DecemberFebruary 1979/802001/02). Extreme wet (dry) events are defined according to 75th (25th) percentiles of precipitation anomaly distributions observed in two time scales: intraseasonal and interannual. The agreement between the 25th and 75th percentiles of the GPCP precipitation and gridded precipitation obtained from stations in Brazil is also examined. Variations of extreme wet and dry anomalies on interannual time scales are investigated along with variations of sea surface temperature (SST) and circulation anomalies. The South Atlantic SST dipole seems related to interannual variations of extreme precipitation events over southeastern Brazil. It is shown that extreme wet and dry events in the continental portion of the South Atlantic convergence zone (SACZ) are decoupled from extremes over the oceanic portion of the SACZ and there is no coherent dipole of extreme precipitation regimes between tropics and subtropics on interannual time scales. On intraseasonal time scales, the occurrence of extreme dry and wet events depends on the propagation phase of extratropical wave trains and consequent intensification (weakening) of 200-hPa zonal winds. Extreme wet and dry events over southeastern Brazil and subtropical Atlantic are in phase on intraseasonal time scales. Extreme wet events over southeastern Brazil and subtropical Atlantic are observed in association with low-level northerly winds above the 75th percentile of the seasonal climatology over central-eastern South America. Extreme wet events on intraseasonal time scales over southeastern Brazil are more frequent during seasons not classified as extreme wet or dry on interannual time scales."

Magnetic permanently confined micelle arrays (Mag-PCMAs) have been successfully synthesized as sorbents for hydrophobic organic compound (HOC) removal from contaminated media. The synthesis of Mag-PCMAs involves coating a silica/surfactant mesostructured hybrid layer on the negatively charged Fe(3)O(4) microparticles to create a core/shell structure. The surfactant, 3-(trimethoxysily)propyl-octadecyldimethyl-ammonium chloride (TPODAC), has a reactive endgroup -Si(OCH(3))(3) on its hydrophilic groups, which allows the surfactant micelles to permanently anchor on the silica framework through covalent bonding. This unique structural property avoids surfactant loss during application and allows for sorbent regeneration. The isotherms and kinetics of four representative HOCs (atrazine, diuron, naphthalene, and biphenyl) onto Mag-PCMAs were determined, and the regeneration and reusability of Mag-PCMAs for diuron removal was also investigated. As a proof of principle for application of Mag-PCMAs for soil-washing, the use of Mag-PCMAs for removal of diuron from a contaminated soil was also demonstrated. All of the results showed that Mag-PCMAs are reusable sorbents for fast, convenient, and highly efficient removal of HOCs from contaminated media."
2,2.0,0.2874,"scale, spatial, distribution, temporal, pattern, range, large, local, variability, time","Synchrony in dynamics of giant kelp forests is driven by both local recruitment and regional environmental controls Populations of many species display spatially synchronous fluctuations in abundance. Synchrony is most commonly attributed to three processes: factors that influence recruitment (e.g., dispersal, early survival), large-scale environmental variability, and spatially autocorrelated trophic interactions. However it is often difficult to link population synchrony to a specific dominant process, particularly when multiple synchronizing forces are operating. We utilized a new satellite-based data set of giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) canopy biomass to examine population synchrony in southern California kelp forests on spatial scales ranging from 50 m to 300 km and temporal scales ranging from 1 to 11 years. We examined the relationship between synchrony and distance for adult kelp populations, kelp recruits, sea urchin abundance (a major grazer of kelp), and environmental variables known to influence kelp population dynamics. Population synchrony in giant kelp decreased with distance between populations: an initial rapid exponential decrease between 50 m and 1.3 km was followed by a second, large-scale decrease between distances of 1.3 km and 172 km. The 50-m to 1.3-km spatial scale corresponded to the scales of synchrony in the abundance of sea urchins and young kelp recruits, suggesting that local drivers of predation and recruitment influence small-scale synchrony in kelp populations. The spatial correlation patterns of environmental variables, particularly wave height, were similar to the synchrony-distance relationship of kelp populations from 1.3 km to 172 km, suggesting that regional environmental variability, i.e., the Moran effect, was the dominant process affecting synchrony at larger spatial scales. This two-step pattern in the relationship between kelp biomass synchrony and distance was apparent in each of the 11 years of our study. Our results highlight the potential for synthesizing approaches from both landscape and population ecology in order to identify the multiple processes that generate synchrony in population dynamics."

Cu-containing nanopesticides are increasingly being used as fungicides in modern agriculture . However, their fate, transport and toxicity in crop plants have been less studied. Here, we exposed 3 week-old cucumber plants cultivated in artificial media to different concentrations of a Cu(OH) 2 nanopesticide (0, 2.5 and 25 mg) for 7 d. The physiological and molecular responses were investigated. In order to elucidate the contribution of copper ions to the response, we also exposed the plants to CuSO 4 . Results showed that the Cu(OH) 2 nanopesticide did not reduce the photosynthetic pigment production. In contrast, 10 mg Cu ions induced a significant decrease in photosynthetic pigment levels (around 25%) and leaf chlorosis symptoms. Foliar exposure to 25 mg Cu(OH) 2 nanopesticide induced significant changes in mRNA levels of antioxidant and detoxification-related genes; 6 genes ( SOD , GPX4 , GPX , MDAR , POD , WRKY6 ) were up-regulated up to 9-fold, and one ( cAPX ) was down-regulated by 32%. The Cu(OH) 2 nanopesticide at both dose levels (2.5 and 25 mg per plant) decreased the transcript production of a stress-related gene ( DNAJ) by 40% and 80%, respectively. The up-regulation of the transcript levels of SOD, GPX4 , GPX , MDAR , POD , and WRKY6 and down-regulation of DNAJ was also observed in CuSO 4 treated plants (with increases of up to 7-fold), indicating that most of the responses are due to released copper ions. We postulate that the increased mRNA levels of antioxidants and detoxification enzymes reflect plant adaptation to over-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) triggered by copper ions. The activated genes could serve as potential biomarkers of nanopesticide exposure and may be applicable to other plant/Cu nanopesticide interactions."

Snowmelt runoff forecasting in mountainous areas such as the western United States has developed as empirical models forced by sparse in situ measurements of snow water equivalent that lie primarily in subalpine regions. Not only do the seasonal forecast models already have large errors in some years they rely on a data record that assumes stationarity and therefore are theoretically ill suited for water manage- ment in a changing climate. Moreover they are unable to accurately address water resources during extreme events such as persisting spring snow or new snowfall in the alpine zone above almost all measurement sites. In response to this need for better assessment of the snow resource in mountain areas new Earth System Data Records that use MODIS data have become available. However they have not been rigorously validated and uncertainties and the possible presence of systematic error are not known. In this investigation we propose to undertake this necessary validation through four years because the products will evolve. The specific Earth System Data Records are: Daily MODIS fractional snow cover. MODIS fractional snow cover based on the normalized difference snow index originally developed for Landsat [Dozier 1989; Hall et al. 2006] available from Terra (product MOD10A1) since 2000 and from Aqua (product MYD10A1) since 2002 [Salomonson and Appel 2004 2006]. MODIS fractional snow cover based on spectral mixing [Painter et al. 2009] available for the Sierra Nevada since 2000 but produced on demand for any MODIS scene. The al- gorithm will be used for the NOAA/NOHRSC National Snow Model starting in water year 2010-11 and has been adopted for the GOES-R Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) sched- uled for launch in the 2015 timeframe. Snow albedo of the fractional snow cover based on choosing the snow endmember from spectral mixing that minimizes the residual error [Painter et al. 2009]. A snow albedo prod- uct is also available for the normal binary (snow vs no-snow) snow-covered area product [Klein and Stroeve 2002] but it is usually applied to continuous snow cover. MODIS fractional snow cover and albedo smoothed and interpolated across time and space to compensate for cloud cover off-nadir viewing and data dropouts [Dozier et al. 2008]. The analyses are available as monthly data cubes during the snow seasons for the Sierra Nevada since 2000. The coupling presented here of fractional snow cover and the albedo of that snow provides water managers with spatially and temporally dense data records that populate modeling in- puts for forecasting and research. Their use in snowmelt models and reservoir operations would be advanced by our proposed investigation which would validate the products analyze the structure of errors and advise users of caveats and likely accuracy. Of greatest interest is their potential combination with surface data and energy balance models to help estimate the -1-spatial distribution of snow water equivalent (SWE). SWE can be interpolated in near real time from snow pillow and snow course measurements constraining the surface measurements by satellite snow-cover estimates [Fassnacht et al. 2003]. In addition SWE can be reconstructed from satellite snow-cover estimates and snow-depletion models [Martinec and Rango 1981; Cline et al. 1998; Molotch 2009].
5,5.0,0.6423,"ca, age, formation, arc, extension, early, rift, area, time, record","Synvolcanic crustal extension during the mid-Cenozoic ignimbrite flare-up in the northern Sierra Madre Occidental, Mexico: Evidence from the Guazapares Mining District region, western Chihuahua The timing and spatial extent of mid-Cenozoic ignimbrite flare-up volcanism of the Sierra Madre Occidental silicic large igneous province of Mexico in relation to crustal extension is relatively unknown. Extension in the Sierra Madre Occidental has been variably interpreted to have preceded, postdated, or begun during Early Oligocene flare-up volcanism of the silicic large igneous province. New geologic mapping, zircon U-Pb laser ablationinductively coupled plasmamass spectrometry dating, modal analysis, and geochemical data from the Guazapares Mining District region along the western edge of the northern Sierra Madre Occidental silicic large igneous province have identified three informal synextensional formations. The ca. 27.5 Ma Parajes formation is an º1-km-thick succession composed primarily of welded to nonwelded silicic outflow ignimbrite sheets erupted from distant sources. The 2724.5 Ma T moris formation is interpreted as an andesitic volcanic center composed of locally erupted mafic to intermediate composition lavas and associated intrusions, with interbedded andesite-clast fluvial and debris flow deposits, and an upper section of thin distal silicic outflow ignimbrites. The 24.523 Ma Sierra Guazapares formation is composed of silicic vent facies ignimbrites to proximal ignimbrites, lavas, plugs, dome-collapse deposits, and fluvially or debris flowreworked equivalents. These three formations record (1) the accumulation of outflow ignimbrite sheets, presumably erupted from calderas mapped º50100 km east of the study area that were active during the Early Oligocene pulse of the mid-Cenozoic ignimbrite flare-up; (2) development of an andesitic volcanic field in the study area, likely related to rocks of the Southern Cordillera basaltic andesite province that were intermittently erupted across all of the northern Sierra Madre Occidental toward the end of and following the Early Oligocene ignimbrite pulse; and (3) the initiation of explosive and effusive silicic fissure magmatism in the study area during the Early Miocene pulse of the mid-Cenozoic ignimbrite flare-up. The main geologic structures identified in the Guazapares Mining District region are NNWtrending normal faults, with an estimated minimum of 20% total horizontal extension. Normal faults were active during deposition of all three formations (Parajes, T moris, and Sierra Guazapares), and bound half-graben basins that show evidence of synvolcanic extension (e.g., growth strata) during deposition. Normal faulting began by ca. 27.5 Ma during deposition of the youngest ignimbrites of the Parajes formation, concurrent with the end of the Early Oligocene silicic ignimbrite pulse to the east and before magmatism began in the study area. In addition, preexisting normal faults localized andesitic volcanic vents of the T moris formation and silicic vents of the Sierra Guazapares formation, and some faults were reactivated during, as well as after, deposition of these formations. We interpret extensional faulting and magmatism in the Guazapares Mining District region to be part of a regional-scale Middle Eocene to Early Miocene southwestward migration of active volcanism and crustal extension in the northern Sierra Madre Occidental. We show that extension accompanied silicic volcanism in the Guazapares region, and overlapped with the peak of mid-Cenozoic ignimbrite flare-up in the Sierra Madre Occidental; this supports the interpretation that there is a relationship between lithospheric extension and silicic large igneous province magmatism."

Further lakes are anticipated to be sentinels of climate change with the balance between autotrophic growth and respiration in lakes anticipated to change with increased anthropogenic activity in their watersheds and with climate change. Studies have been and are being conducted worldwide to assess the role of lakes and reservoirs in regional and global carbon cycles and efforts are underway to estimate metabolic activity in lakes. Essential to both efforts are accurate estimates of gas fluxes at the air-water interface. The gas transfer coefficient used in the calculation of fluxes depends upon turbulence at the air-water interface but in most biogeochemical studies either a fixed conservative value is used or one based on wind speed alone. Other processes which cause turbulence are neglected. We estimate that regional carbon budgets are in error by at least a factor of two and likely higher in warm water lakes due to incorrect parameterization of the gas transfer coefficient. The error is unknown in cold water lakes. The surface renewal model takes into account the various processes which induce turbulence in near-surface waters yet has never been validated for lakes. We propose to combine direct air-water flux measurements of carbon dioxide using eddy covariance techniques with in situ measurements of the water-side CO2 concentration profile turbulence and energy fluxes to evaluate and improve upon the surface renewal model of the gas transfer coefficient. We further propose studies using SF6 in lakes too small for EC studies with measurements taken on time scales of events which drive gas flux. We propose studies in an arctic temperate zone and tropical lake to capture the latitudinal variations in physical forcing which affect turbulence near the air-water interface. Our overarching goal is a formulation of the gas transfer coefficient which can be readily applied in ecosystem studies of lakes at any latitude. 
7,7.0,0.583,"fault, rate, fold, basin, deformation, km, active, structure, slip, central","Basin width control of faulting in the Naryn Basin, south central Kyrgyzstan In Central Asias Tien Shan, deformation is distributed across the wide orogen, a characteristic of intracontinental mountain building. Active faults are commonly found within intramontane basins that separate its constituent ranges. In order to explore the controls on this intramontane basin deformation, we study the Naryn Basin of south-central Kyrgyzstan. A series of five balanced cross-sections reveals a transition in patterns of faulting from faults confined to basin margins to faults focused within the basin center. The 20-km-wide eastern Naryn Basin displays deformation attributed to low-angle splays of the northern, basin-bounding fault. In the 40-km-wide western Naryn Basin, the pattern of deformation linked to the northern range remains, but is accompanied by steeper faults that dip both south and north without being directly linked to the basin-bounding fault. We compare these cross-sections to synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) measurements of surface deformation. Profiles of InSAR-derived surface deformation rates across the Naryn Basin reveal that in the west, deformation is distributed across the broad basin interior, whereas in the east, rapid uplift is concentrated at the margin of the narrower basin. From the geodetic and structural data, we infer that in the western Naryn Basin, deformation has migrated away from the northern basin margin and into the interior. Deformation of the eastern basin interior, however, remains linked to the basin-bounding fault. A simple mechanical model demonstrates that basin width may control basin deformation whereby basin-interior faulting in the narrow, eastern Naryn Basin is inhibited by the overburden of adjacent ranges."
8,8.0,0.466,"coastal, california, groundwater, water, central, coast, rate, time, determine, potential",Linking coastal contamination to the local sewage system using a sulfer hexaflouride as deliberate tracer As part of a larger study being conducted by Dr. Stanley Grant (UC Irvine) a deliberate tracer experiment will be initiated by the UCSB group using sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). The methodology to be used was developed by Dr. Jordan Clark at UCSB to investigate the movement (travel times) of artificially recharged water near spreading ponds. Dr. Clarks group has conducted groundwater tracer experiments in numerous locations in southern California (Gamlin et al. 2001; Clark et al. 2004 2005; Avisar and Clark 2005; McDermott et al. 2008). His group has also used SF6 to investigate mine drainage contamination to Clear Lake (Schladow and Clark 2008) and dispersion in the Stockton Deep Water Shipping Channel (Schmieder et al. 2008). In all cases permission was asked for and granted to use SF6 as a tracer in California aquifers. During the initial phase of the proposed experiment tracer-rich water will be released into the sewer lines as a series of hourly slug additions over a tidal cycle. The tracer rich water will be created by equilibrating about 20 liters of water with pure SF6 in a closed container. I expect that the finally SF6 concentration to be more than 10% of the equilibrium value. During the second phase water samples will be collected at location along the beach in pre weighed 10 ml VacutainersTM and sent to UCSB for analysis. All SF6 samples will be analyzed using a headspace method similar to that described by Clark et al. (2004). The VacutainersTM will be partially filled (about 5 ml of water) in the field. At UCSB they will be weighed (to determine the sample size) and carefully filled with ultra-high purity nitrogen gas (so that the final head space pressure is equal to about 1 atmosphere). After a brief shaking to equilibrate the nitrogen gas with the water sample the headspace gas will be injected through a column of Mg(ClO4)2 (to remove water vapor) into a small sample loop of known volume (about 1 ml). Subsequently the gas in the sample loop will be flushed into a gas chromatograph equipped with an electron capture detector with ultra-high purity nitrogen carrier gas. SF6 will be separated from other gases with a molecular sieve 5a column held at room temperature. The detector response will be determined by running gas standards purchased from Scott-Marrin Inc. With this method error on duplicate measurements is typically better than ¬±10%. Laboratory experiments have shown that SF6 samples can be stored for at least 6 months without appreciable loss of SF6 in VacutainerTM. The detection limit of this method is about 0.1 pmol/L so we will be able to detect sewer water after a 100000:1 dilution even if some SF6 is lost due to water-air gas transfer. SF6 a non-toxic and non-reactive gas is an ideal tracer of groundwater flow. It has been shown in laboratory experiments and during a field experiment conducted near Phoenix AZ that in the absence of non-aqueous phases its movement is not retarded in porous media (Wilson and Mackay 1993 1996; Gamlin et al. 2001; Lee et al. 2008). It has been used as a tracer for mixing and gas exchange for decades in a number of settings including lakes rivers and the open ocean (e.g. Wanninkhof 1985 1987; Ledwell et al. 1986; Clark et al. 1996; Schladow and Clark 2008; Schmieder et al. 2008; MacInyre et al. 2009). More recently SF6 has been used successfully in groundwater studies in California (Orange LA and Ventura Counties) that traced the movement of artificially recharged water through groundwater systems (Gamlin et al. 2001; Clark et al. 2004 2005; Avisar and Clark 2005; McDermott et al. 2008) and mine pit water into Clear Lake (Schladow and Clark 2008). In all cases permission was requested and granted by the Department of Public Health to use SF6 as a tracer in these potable supply aquifers. There are a number of advantages of using SF6 as a tracer of artificial recharge. First SF6 is more economical than most other tracers (such as Br- and Rhodamine dye) and hence more water can be tagged decreasing the probability that the tracers will pass wells undetected. Second it does not change the density of the tagged water thus buoyancy effects do not complicate the interpretation of the experimental results (e.g. Istok and Humphrey 1995). Third SF6 does not degrade the quality of the water; it causes no known adverse health effects (Lester and Greenberg 1950). Forth because it is a gas SF6 can be removed from water easily by aeration. In fact any SF6 that is discharged in to the bay will be lost to the atmosphere within a few weeks.
9,9.0,0.5902,"record, age, ice, glacial, glacier, change, date, sea_level, present, retreat","Rapid last-deglacial thinning and retreat of the marine-terminating southwestern Greenland ice sheet Marine-terminating outlet glaciers are a major source of modern ice loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS), but their role in GrIS retreat during the last deglaciation is not well constrained. Here, we develop deglacial outlet glacier retreat chronologies for four regions in southwest and south Greenland to improve understanding of spatial variations in centennial- to millennial-scale ice loss under a warming climate. We calculate 10Be surface exposure ages of boulders located in fjords near the towns of Qaqortoq, Paamiut, Nuuk, and Sisimiut. Our northernmost study site, Sisimiut, deglaciated earliest at º18 ka to º15 ka with an average thinning rate of 0.10.3 m yr1. Inland retreat from Sisimiut to the modern ice margin took º7 ka at an average retreat rate of 1520 m yr1. A 10Be-dated moraine º25 km from the modern GrIS margin deposited at º8 ka suggests a possible ice-margin still-stand, but this does not change overall retreat rates. After retreat from the small coastal Sisimiut fjords, the GrIS margin was mainly land-terminating in this region. In contrast, earliest exposure occurred at º12 ka near Qaqortoq, and 1110 ka near Nuuk and Paamiut, with ice thinning at rates of 0.20.3 m yr1 to instantaneous within measurement uncertainty. Ice retreat inland through the extensive Nuuk, Paamiut, and Qaqortoq fjord systems to near modern ice margins occurred in <1 ka, resulting in minimum retreat rates of 2565 m yr1 and maximum retreat rates of º95 m yr1 to instantaneous within the uncertainty of our measurements. This rapid thinning and retreat of marine-terminating southwest GrIS margins is contemporaneous with an incursion of relatively warm ocean waters into the Labrador Sea and toward the southwest Greenland coast, suggesting that a warming ocean may have contributed to the more rapid retreat of marine GrIS termini in the Nuuk, Paamiut, and Qaqortoq fjord systems relative to the slower ice retreat inland from Sisimiut. Our results highlight past outlet glacierocean interaction as a potentially important driver in rapid GrIS retreat."
10,10.0,0.5542,"deep, depth, sea, oil, show, surface, shallow, bubble, marine, process","Uplifting of carbon monoxide from biomass burning and anthropogenic sources to the free troposphere in East Asia East Asia has experienced rapid development with increasing carbon monoxide (CO) emission in the past decades. Therefore, uplifting CO from the boundary layer to the free troposphere in East Asia can have great implications on regional air quality around the world. It can also influence global climate due to the longer lifetime of CO at higher altitudes. In this study, three cases of high CO episodes in the East China Sea and the Sea of Japan from 2003 to 2005 are examined with spaceborne Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) data, in combination with aircraft measurements from the Measurement of Ozone and Water Vapor by Airbus In-Service Aircraft (MOZAIC) program. High CO abundances of 300550 ppbv are observed in MOZAIC data in the free troposphere during these episodes. These are among the highest CO abundances documented at these altitudes. On average, such episodes with CO over 400 ppbv (in the 2003 and 2004 cases) and between 200 and 300 ppbv (in the 2005 case) may occur 25 and 1020% in time, respectively, in the respective altitudes over the region. Correspondingly, elevated CO is shown in MOPITT daytime data in the middle to upper troposphere in the 2003 case, in the lower to middle troposphere in the 2004 case, and in the upper troposphere in the 2005 case. Through analyses of the simulations from a chemical transport model GEOS-Chem and a trajectory dispersion model FLEXPART, we found different CO signatures in the elevated CO and distinct transport pathways and mechanisms for these cases. In the 2003 case, emissions from large forest fires near Lake Baikal dominated the elevated CO, which had been rapidly transported upward by a frontal system from the fire plumes. In the 2004 case, anthropogenic CO from the North China Plain experienced frontal lifting and mostly reached ~ 700 hPa near the East China Sea, while CO from biomass burning over Indochina experienced orographic lifting, lee-side-trough-induced convection, and frontal lifting through two separate transport pathways, leading to two distinct CO enhancements around 700 and 300 hPa. In the 2005 case, the observed CO of ~ 300 ppbv around 300 hPa originated from anthropogenic sources over the Sichuan Basin and the North China Plain and from forest fires over Indochina. The high CO was transported to such altitudes through strong frontal lifting, interacting with convection and orographic lifting. These cases show that topography affects vertical transport of CO in East Asia via different ways, including orographic uplifting over the Hengduan Mountains, assisting frontal lifting in the North China Plain, and facilitating convection in the Sichuan Basin. In particular, topography-induced lee-side troughs over Indochina led to strong convection that assisted CO uplifting to the upper troposphere. This study shows that the new daytime MOPITT near-infrared (NIR) and thermal-infrared (TIR) data (version 5 or above) have enhanced vertical sensitivity in the free troposphere and may help qualitative diagnosis of vertical transport processes in East Asia."
11,11.0,0.4113,"river, flow, channel, stream, sediment, watershed, flood, floodplain, discharge, downstream","Hydraulic and geomorphic processes in an overbank flood along a meandering, gravel bed river: implications for chute formation Hydraulic interactions between rivers and floodplains produce off-channel chutes, the presence of which influences the routing of water and sediment and thus the planform evolution of meandering rivers. Detailed studies of the hydrologic exchanges between channels and floodplains are usually conducted in laboratory facilities, and studies documenting chute development are generally limited to qualitative observations. In this study, we use a reconstructed, gravel-bedded, meandering river as a field laboratory for studying these mechanisms at a realistic scale. Using an integrated field and modeling approach, we quantified the flow exchanges between the river channel and its floodplain during an overbank flood, and identified locations where flow had the capacity to erode floodplain chutes. Hydraulic measurements and modeling indicated high rates of flow exchange between the channel and floodplain, with flow rapidly decelerating as water was decanted from the channel onto the floodplain due to the frictional drag provided by substrate and vegetation. Peak shear stresses were greatest downstream of the maxima in bend curvature, along the concave bank, where terrestrial LiDAR scans indicate initial floodplain chute formation. A second chute has developed across the convex bank of a meander bend, in a location where sediment accretion, point bar development and plant colonization have created divergent flow paths between the main channel and floodplain. In both cases, the off-channel chutes are evolving slowly during infrequent floods due to the coarse nature of the floodplain, though rapid chute formation would be more likely in finer-grained floodplains. The controls on chute formation at these locations include the flood magnitude, river curvature, floodplain gradient, erodibility of the floodplain sediment, and the flow resistance provided by riparian vegetation.

The composition of MAD559 was quantified by calibration relative to the welldocumented zircon reference material 91500, for which we compiled existing published data (Mg, Al, Y, rare earth elements, Hf, U, Th) and performed new measurements to characterise the mass fraction of less commonly measured elements (Li, Be, B, F, Na, P, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, Fe, Nb). Measurement results of SL13, CZ3 and MAD1 zircons and NIST SRM glasses were performed as quality control materials to test measurement bias and repeatability. We show the intermediate precision for most trace element measurement results of MAD559 to be between 3% and 5% RSD based on 139 measurements by SIMS on twentyfive individual polished zircon chips measured during a 24h period, as well as repeat measurements performed over five separate analytical sessions. Trace element mass fractions were also measured by LAICPMS in two different laboratories, and major element compositions measured by electron microprobe, to compare with results measured by SIMS. Based on laser Raman and hyperspectral cathodoluminescence spectroscopy, we show MAD559 to have high crystal disorder due to radiation damage relative to crystalline zircon (e.g., SL13 and 91500 zircon). Although the high cumulative alpha dose of MAD559 zircon makes it a poor reference material for geochronology, the consistency of the trace element mass fraction results measured in multiple sessions and by various measurement methods shows that it is an ideal reference material for microanalytical trace element mass fraction quantification of zircon. Composition of new zircon reference material (MAD559) for calibrating trace element mass fractions measured by SIMS. MAD559 is homogeneous and repeatable for most trace elements (e.g., Sc, Ti, Nb, Y, REE, Th U). New results ensure accurate and consistent comparison for mass fractions measured by different measurement principles using MAD1, MAD559, 91500, CZ3, SL13 or other zircon reference materials."

In the past, the development of self-organized symbioses has been demonstrated to be more successful and beneficial. However, in the absence of effective communication channels among companies, efforts to transform the conventional industrial complexes into EIPs need to stimulate the development of symbioses with a systematic design approach. To develop and implement such symbioses (described as designed networks), the Ulsan EIP center devised a research and development into business (R&DB) framework for the effective expansion of symbioses in the industrial complexes. Based on this framework, the Ulsan EIP center has so far facilitated forty symbioses, out of which thirteen networks are currently in operation, twenty are under negotiation and/or design, and seven are under feasibility investigation/evaluation. This paper might serve as an out of experience guideline for other worldwide EIP initiatives, wherein we demonstrate the viability of designed symbiosis networks using policy instruments like national EIP programs, the presence of facilitators such as an EIP center, and an enabling framework such as the R&DB framework that are observed to be critical factors for retro-fitting the conventional industrial complexes into EIPs."
14,14.0,0.5433,"soil, microbial, plant, nitrogen, ecosystem, dry, decomposition, litter, effect, root","Effects of altered dry season length and plant inputs on soluble soil carbon Soil moisture controls microbial activity and soil carbon cycling. Because microbial activity decreases as soils dry, decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) is thought to decrease with increasing drought length. Yet, microbial biomass and a pool of water-extractable organic carbon (WEOC) can increase as soils dry, perhaps implying microbes may continue to break down SOM even if drought stressed. Here, we test the hypothesis that WEOC increases as soils dry because exoenzymes continue to break down litter, while their products accumulate because they cannot diffuse to microbes. To test this hypothesis, we manipulated field plots by cutting off litter inputs and by irrigating and excluding precipitation inputs to extend or shorten the length of the dry season. We expected that the longer the soils would remain dry, the more WEOC would accumulate in the presence of litter, whereas shortening the length of the dry season, or cutting off litter inputs, would reduce WEOC accumulation. Lastly, we incubated grass roots in the laboratory and measured the concentration of reducing sugars and potential hydrolytic enzyme activities, strictly to understand the mechanisms whereby exoenzymes break down litter over the dry season. As expected, extending dry season length increased WEOC concentrations by 30% above the 108 Œºg C/g measured in untreated plots, whereas keeping soils moist prevented WEOC from accumulating. Contrary to our hypothesis, excluding plant litter inputs actually increased WEOC concentrations by 40% above the 105 Œºg C/g measured in plots with plants. Reducing sugars did not accumulate in dry senesced roots in our laboratory incubation. Potential rates of reducing sugar production by hydrolytic enzymes ranged from 0.7 to 10 Œºmol g-1 h-1 and far exceeded the rates of reducing sugar accumulation (~0.001 Œºmol g-1 h-1 ). Our observations do not support the hypothesis that exoenzymes continue to break down litter to produce WEOC in dry soils. Instead, we develop the argument that physical processes are more likely to govern short-term WEOC dynamics via slaking of microaggregates that stabilize SOM and through WEOC redistribution when soils wet up, as well as through less understood effects of drought on the soil mineral matrix."

However, studies utilizing satellite-measured SIF in South America have concentrated on the Amazonian tropical forest, while SIF in other regions and vegetation classes remain uninvestigated. We examined three years of Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) SIF data for vegetation classes within and across the six Brazilian biomes (Amazon, Atlantic Forest, Caatinga, Cerrado, Pampa, and Pantanal) to answer the following: (1) how does satellite-measured SIF differ? (2) What is the relationship (strength and direction) of satellite-measured SIF with canopy temperature (Tcan), air temperature (Tair), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD)? (3) How does the phenology of satellite-measured SIF (duration and amplitude of seasonal integrated SIF) compare? Our analysis shows that OCO-2 captures a significantly higher mean SIF with lower variability in the Amazon and lower mean SIF with higher variability in the Caatinga compared to other biomes. OCO-2 also distinguishes the mean SIF of vegetation types within biomes, showing that evergreen broadleaf (EBF) mean SIF is significantly higher than other vegetation classes (deciduous broadleaf (DBF), grassland (GRA), savannas (SAV), and woody savannas (WSAV)) in all biomes. We show that the strengths and directions of correlations of OCO-2 mean SIF to Tcan, Tair, and VPD largely cluster by biome: negative in the Caatinga and Cerrado, positive in the Pampa, and no correlations were found in the Pantanal, while results were mixed for the Amazon and Atlantic Forest. We found mean SIF most strongly correlated with VPD in most vegetation classes in most biomes, followed by Tcan. Seasonality from time series analysis reveals that OCO-2 SIF measurements capture important differences in the seasonal timing of SIF for different classes, details masked when only examining mean SIF differences. We found that OCO-2 captured the highest base integrated SIF and lowest seasonal pulse integrated SIF in the Amazon for all vegetation classes, indicating continuous photosynthetic activity in the Amazon exceeds other biomes, but with small seasonal increases. Surprisingly, Pantanal EBF SIF had the highest total integrated SIF of all classes in all biomes due to a large seasonal pulse. Additionally, the length of seasons only accounts for about 30% of variability in total integrated SIF; thus, integrated SIF is likely captures differences in photosynthetic activity separate from structural differences. Our results show that satellite measurements of SIF can distinguish important functioning and phenological differences in vegetation classes and thus has the potential to improve our understanding of productivity and seasonality in the tropics."
16,16.0,0.454,"ocean, global, carbon, phytoplankton, export, nutrient, particle, production, concentration, surface","Transparent exopolymer particles: Effects on carbon cycling in the ocean Transparent Exopolymer Particles (TEP) have received considerable attention since they were first described in the ocean more than 20years ago. This is because of their carbon-rich composition, their high concentrations in oceans surface waters, and especially because of their ability to promote aggregation due to their high stickiness (i.e.biological glue). As large aggregates contribute significantly to vertical carbon flux, TEP are commonly seen as a key factor that drives the downward flux of particulate organic carbon (POC). However, the density of TEP is lower than that of seawater, which causes them to remain in surface waters and even move upwards if not ballasted by other particles, which often leads to their accumulation in the sea surface microlayer. Hence we question here the generally accepted view that TEP always increase the downward flux of POC via gravitational settling. In the present reassessment of the role of TEP, we examine how the presence of a pool of non-sinking carbon-rich particulate organic matter in surface waters influences the cycling of organic carbon in the upper ocean at daily to decadal time scales. In particular, we focus on the role of TEP in the retention of organic carbon in surface waters versus downward export, and discuss the potential consequences of climate change on this process and on the efficiency of the biological carbon pump. We show that TEP sink only when ballasted with enough high-density particles to compensate their low density, and hence that their role in vertical POC export is not solely linked to their ability to promote aggregation, but also to their contribution to the buoyancy of POC. It follows that the TEP fraction of POC determines the degree of retention and remineralization of POC in surface waters versus its downward export. A high TEP concentration may temporally decouple primary production and downward export. We identify two main parameters that affect the contribution of TEP to POC cycling; TEP stickiness, and the balance between TEP production and degradation rates. Because stickiness, production and degradation of TEP vary with environmental conditions, the role of TEP in controlling the balance between retention versus export, and hence the drawdown of atmospheric CO2 by the biological carbon pump, can be highly variable, and is likely to be affected by climate change."
17,17.0,0.5677,"wave, surface, current, wind, velocity, observation, depth, flow, small, ocean","Improved Methods to Calculate Depth-Resolved Velocities from Glider-Mounted ADCPs Ocean gliders are autonomous underwater vehicles typically used to sample spatial variations in scalar variables (e.g., temperature, salinity, and bio-optical water properties) along transects. More recently, gliders have been equipped with ADCPs for measuring current profiles along transects. Accurate measurement of velocity profiles from a moving platform requires knowledge of the platform motion over the earth. Determination of glider motion over the earth relies on glider GPS positions available only at times of glider surfacing. Glider surfacing intervals typically range from 10s of minutes to hours, precluding accurate instantaneous knowledge of glider motion. This is a major challenge for measuring velocity profiles from ocean gliders. One approach for determining vertical velocity profiles from glider-mounted ADCPs relies on estimating depth-integrated currents averaged between glider surfacings. Once estimated, vertically averaged velocity can be combined with horizontal glider velocities relative to the water to obtain depth-resolved velocities using methods of Visbeck (2001) and Todd et al. (2011). The vertically averaged velocity is calculated from the distance the glider strays from its projected position during the time between surfacings. This distance is computed as the difference between the dead-reckoned surfacing location and the actual surfacing location as measured by GPS. There are numerous methods for computing the dead-reckoned position of glider surfacings, but these have not been evaluated to determine which best predicts surfacing locations. Here, three methods for calculating vertically averaged horizontal current velocities from gliders are evaluated. Two Slocum Coastal G1 gliders (manufactured by Teledyne Webb Research), each with an upward looking 1 MHz ADCP (manufactured by Teledyne RD Instruments), were deployed off the California coast during the summer of 2012. The gliders flew 500 m square patterns around a bottom-mounted, upward-looking 600 kHz ADCP (manufactured by Teledyne RD Instruments) moored at a depth of 26 m. The moored ADCP data are key to evaluating methods for computing vertically averaged velocity from gliders and ultimately assessing depth-resolved current velocities obtained from glider-mounted ADCPs. The first method calculates the gliders horizontal velocity using pitch and vertical velocity. Vertical velocity is calculated by taking the derivative of pressure with respect to time. It is often assumed that the flight path is in the direction of the gliders long axis and Œ±, the angle of attack or the angle between the gliders path through the water and its long axis, is zero. This assumption can result in errors of 2.5 cm s1 (Merckelbach et al. 2001) which are on the order of 10% of the horizontal velocity. Previous studies have estimated angle of attack (e.g. Sherman et al. 2001) using model results for internally-mounted ADCPs on Spray gliders. The gliders in this study carried externally-mounted ADCPs, so errors may also result from extra drag and non-zero values of $a$. The value of Œ± is found by maximizing the $\text{r}^{2}$ of vertically averaged velocities found by this method with vertically averaged velocities from the mooring. The second method directly measures currents using the ADCPs mounted on the gliders. Water velocity relative to the glider is obtained from the ADCP bin nearest the glider which is 1m long and begins 1.2 m from the glider. This velocity is calculated on glider upcasts and downcasts in east-north-up (ENU) coordinates. Velocities in ENU coordinates are derived from software provided with the ADCP. The third method uses velocities measured along the ADCP beams in so-called beam coordinates. Directly measured velocity can then be used (see Todd et al. 2011) from the component of the ADCP beams oriented in the direction parallel to the gliders long axis this can be 2 or 3 beams depending on the transducer head on the ADCP. Experimentation with these data and this method is ongoing and will be compared with the previously mentioned methods. The three methods are used to estimate vertically averaged currents from the gliders, and these are compared with vertically averaged currents from the bottom-mounted ADCP. Of the three methods, the first produces the highest correlations (r2 values). However, it is necessary to estimate the angle of attack when using the first method."

The newly developed algorithm is based on a simple semi-empirical model, the Hp model. Through analyzing the simulated database of the Advanced Integral Equation Model (AIEM) under SMAP (Soil Moisture Active and Passive) sensor configurations, it was found that the surface roughness can be cancelled out using the relationship between the V and H polarization surface reflectivity. This leads to a new method for estimation of the soil dielectric properties directly from the radiometer measurements. The simulated data and ground radiometer measurements of bare surface obtained from Beltsville Agriculture Research Center (BARC) during 19791981 were used for validation. The inversion accuracy with RMSE (root-mean-square error) for simulated data and bare surface experimental data are 0.014 m3/m3 and 0.036 m3/m3, respectively. The soil moisture retrieval in vegetated area was performed using the PALS radiometer measurements at L-band during Soil Moisture Experiments in 2002 (SMEX02). The retrieval error was higher for the SMEX02 data, with overall RMSE of 0.043 m3/m3, due to the high vegetation water content. Using SMOS data in Yanco region soil moisture was retrieved and evaluated, the results are encouraging, with the RMSE of 0.043 m3/m3 and 0.041 m3/m3 for ascending and descending, respectively. However, the algorithm performed satisfactorily over the all surface cover conditions including bare and vegetated region."

A recent hypothesis posits that evolutionary relatedness may also explain the prevalence of mutualisms, with facilitative interactions being more common among distantly related species. Despite the importance of these hypotheses for understanding the structure and function of ecological communities, experimental tests to determine how evolutionary relatedness influences competition and facilitation are still somewhat rare.Here, we report results of a laboratory experiment in which we assessed how competitive and facilitative interactions among eight species of freshwater green algae are influenced by their relatedness. We measured the prevalence of competition and facilitation among 28 pairs of freshwater green algal species that were chosen to span a large gradient of phylogenetic distances. For each species, we first measured its invasion success when introduced into a steady-state population of another resident species. Then, we compared its growth rate when grown alone in monoculture to its growth rate when introduced as an invader. The change in the species population growth rate as an invader (sensitivity) is used as a measure of the strength of its interaction with the resident species. A reduced growth rate in the presence of another species indicates competition, whereas an increased growth rate indicates facilitation.Although competition between species was more frequent (75% of interactions), facilitation was common (the other 25% of interactions). We found no significant relationship between the phylogenetic distance separating two interacting species and the success of invasion, nor the prevalence or strength of either competition or facilitation. Interspecific interactions depended more on the identity of the species, with certain taxa consistently acting as good or bad competitors/facilitators. These species were not predictable a priori from their positions on a phylogeny.Synthesis. The phylogenetic relatedness of the green algae species used here did not predict the prevalence of competitive and facilitative interactions, rejecting the hypothesis that close relatives compete strongly and contesting recent evidence that facilitation is likely to occur between distant relatives."

Since the early 1970s, cloud observations from airfields in coastal Southern California (CSCA) indicate reductions of ~2550% in warmseason frequency of daytime stratus clouds at many sites, including fireprone wildlandurban interface zones. We use 10 years of meteorological, surface radiation, and cloud observations to statistically model the effects of clouds on warmseason surface energy fluxes in CSCA. Forcing our model with cloud observations, we estimate that reduced warmseason cloud shading since the 1970s significantly enhanced daytime solar radiation and evaporative demand throughout much of CSCA, particularly in greater Los Angeles and northern San Diego. Correlation with burned area and live fuel moisture implicates stratus cloud shading as an important driver of warmseason wildfire activity in CSCA. Large reductions in cloud shading have likely enhanced warmseason wildfire potential in many CSCA areas when and where fuels are not limiting. In much of coastal Southern California, the frequency of summer clouds has declined rapidly in recent decades due to warming from urbanization and greenhouse gases. These reductions have significantly reduced cloud shading and increased evaporative demand, particularly in greater Los Angeles and northern San Diego, such that a relatively cloudy summer today is similar to a relatively clear summer in the 1970s. Clouds appear to be important regulators of summer wildfire activity in this region, as the shade they provide slows loss of moisture from vegetation. On the vegetated mountainsides that ring coastal Southern Californias large cities, increases in summer sunlight and evaporative demand have likely enhanced summer wildfire potential over the past several decades. This effect is expected to continue due to continued urban expansion and positive feedbacks, where warming due to cloud loss promotes further warming and cloud loss. Warmseason daytime cloud frequency significantly declined in much of coastal Southern California over the past half century Based on a statistical model, observed reductions in coastal cloud frequency significantly increased net radiation and evaporative demand Correlation analysis suggests that summer cloud frequency significantly affects fuel moisture and burned area in coastal Southern California"

Results of these experiments will comprise a major advance in our understanding of hydrogeologic properties and fluid processes within oceanic crust and will help to develop new tools and methods that can be applied in many settings. Earlier grants funded engineering design and testing in preparation for these experiments; the present proposal is for support of scientific activities that will occur after IODP Expedition 327 beginning in Fall 2010. IODP Expedition 327 will drill and deepen three basement holes and install three new subseafloor borehole observatory systems (CORKs). Expedition 327 will include single and cross-hole hydrogeologic testing to assess multi-scale formation properties including the nature of hypothesized azimuthal and vertical crustal anisotropy. IODP researchers will also conduct singleand multi-hole tracer experiments injecting a mixture of tracers during a 24-hour pumping test in one of the new basement holes and monitoring for tracer arrival at holes 35 m to 2400 m away. We request support for two dive programs in Summer 2011 and 2012 one and two years after drilling followed by analytical and modeling work. The Summer 2011 expedition will include: downloading pressure data and collecting borehole fluid samples from several observatories at multiple depth using valves and samplers at the seafloor exchanging long-term wellhead OsmoSamplers and microbial fluid samplers and attaching an autonomous flow meter to one wellhead and opening a ball valve initiating a long-term cross-hole experiment. We anticipate fluid discharge from the naturally- overpressured formation at 510 L/s for the subsequent year. The Summer 2012 expedition will be similar except that we will recover the flow meter and close the valve on the free-flowing CORK allowing formation pressure to recover. Analytical work will determine fluid and microbial characteristics and relationships and numerical studies will evaluate coupled fluid- thermal-chemical flow processes in the crust with three-dimensional modeling and conditional simulation.

The Chilean leontiniid is from the lower horizons of the Cura-Mall n Formation (Tcm1) at Laguna del Laja in the Andean Main Range of central Chile. This new species, Colpodon antucoensis, is distinguishable from Patagonian species of Colpodon by way of its smaller I2; larger I3 and P1; sharper, V-shaped snout; and squarer upper premolars. The holotype came from a horizon that is constrained below and above by 40Ar/39Ar ages of 19.53 0.60 and 19.25 1.22, respectively, suggesting an age of roughly 19.5 Ma, or a little older (º19.8 Ma) when corrected for a revised age of the Fish Canyon Tuff standard. Either age is slightly younger than ages reported for the Colhuehuapian SALMA fauna at the Gran Barranca. Taxa from the locality of the holotype of C. antucoensis are few, but they (e.g., the mylodontid sloth, Nematherium, and a lagostomine chinchillid) also suggest a post-Colhuehuapian faunal age. The second leontiniid named in this paper has been known in the literature for over 75 years as Leontinia sp. Several specimens referable to this species were discovered at Pico Truncado (Deseadan SALMA) during the Field Museums first Marshall Field Expedition, led by Elmer Riggs in 1924. This new taxon, Elmerriggsia fieldia, is a small-bodied leontiniid, possessing grooved premolar protocones that lack intermediate lingual cingulae, but have well-developed labial cingulids on their lower molars. This new taxon is fairly common at Pico Truncado, in Santa Cruz, Argentina, but we have not encountered it at other localities. The character-taxon matrix that we constructed for this analysis differs from those previously developed for notoungulates by the substantially greater number of postcranial characters used (41). Colbertia magellanica was used as the outgroup in all analyses. Our initial phylogenetic analysis was limited to only taxa traditionally assigned to the Toxodontia. These included a dozen taxa traditionally considered to be leontiniids, two toxodontids, four notohippids, a homalodotheriid, and two isotemnids. The taxa traditionally classified as leontiniids formed a monophyletic group, in which V-shaped muzzle, caniniform i3, femur with medial suprapatellar ridge, and large wedge-shaped fibular facet of the calcaneum were unequivocal synapomorphies. Colpodon spp. nested within a clade that includes the tropical leontiniids, Taubatherium and Huilatherium. Toxodontids and notohippids formed a monophyletic group sister to the leontiniids, with these two clades forming a more inclusive clade that previously had been called the advanced Toxodontia. However, when five species of typotheres from three families were added to the analysis, the notohippid Eurygenium was identified as the nearest outgroup of leontiniids and an advanced notohippid plus toxodontid clade (nodes C + F). Unequivocal synapomorphies uniting these two nodes were robust calcanonavicular articulation (reverse alternating tarsus as evidenced by a distinct navicular facet on the calcaneum) and a distal radius with a styloid process. The presence of an entolophid fossettid in the lower molars and the downturned olecranon process of the ulna were equivocal synapomorphies for this clade. Though lacking the character states that diagnose a more exclusive notohippid-toxodontid-leontiniid clade, Eurygenium shared several unequivocal synapomorphies that unite it with these taxa. These include a well-formed fossette of upper molars formed by the posterior cingulum, absence of an entepicondylar foramen of the humerus, lack of a neck on the astragalus, a transversely elongated astragalar head, and absence of the astragalar buttress of the navicular. Unconventionally, the interatheriids used in the analysis (Federicoanaya and Protypotherium, both interatheriine interatheriids) formed the sister group to the taxa traditionally considered to be the advanced Toxodontia. Unequivocal synapomorphies uniting these interatheriids with the advanced Toxodontia are exclusively postcranial: tetradactyl manus, quadrate fibular facet of the calcaneum, calcaneonavicular contact (without well-formed facet on the calcaneum), and union of the groove for the tendon of the flexor hallucis longus with the astragalar trochlea. Steeply inclined ectal facets of the astragalus and calcaneum are equivocal synapomorphies (shared with Eurygenium, the notohippids, and toxodontids, but not leontiniids). Inclusion of postcranial characters in the phylogenetic analysis illustrates an otherwise undetectable conflictthat of homoplasy-homology discordance between dental and postcranial characters of interatheriine interatheriids (the postcranial skeleton of notopithicine interatheriids [or basal interatheriids of Hitz et al., 2006] remain unknown). This conflict does not simply represent an arcane point, but has relevance regarding reconstructing the interrelation-ships of several major groups of notoungulates. Other findings of this work include a northerly extension of the geographical range of Colpodon and a possible temporal extension beyond the Colhuehuapian SALMA. It appears that the fauna at Laguna del Laja is an important source of information regarding the faunal transition that occurred between Colhuehuapian and Santacrucian SALMA faunas."

Now that much scientific publishing especially data publishing takes place through a database rather than conventional journals how should something that is found in a database be cited? More generally how should digital data that is stored in a repository with internal structure and which is subject to change be cited? This is the case for the very large number of curated databases through which much scientific publishing now takes place; it is also true of most scientific data collections which are seldom stable. There has recently been substantial interest in the problem of data citation and various organizations have proposed structures for the format and content of citations; however most proposals do not address issues of structure and change that are intrinsic to databases. The focus of this proposal is to develop a framework for data citation which takes into account the following issues: (1) the potentially very large number of possible citations; (2) citations should be both human and machine readable; and (3) citations must conform to specifications prescribed by both the publishers of the data and by the various standards that are being established. All these give rise to interesting computational challenges: citations must be generated automatically from the data; the source data must be guaranteed to support the generation of these citations; and the generated citations must be guaranteed to conform to the specifications. Of course as with any computational problem all this must be done efficiently. Citation is also closely related to provenance and issues of reproducible results. Workflows executable papers and microcitations have all been proposed to support reproducible analysis of data. The work of this project will explore the connections between these ideas and where possible establish a common framework. For many databases the publishers and authors have a clear idea of how they would like their data to be cited and there is enough information in the database to enable these citations to be generated once the right computational machinery has been developed. However interesting questions arise when a set of data to be cited is arrived at by means of a query in which case the query itself may need to be included (an actionable citation). In other cases the navigational structure needed for meaningful citation such as in the case with linked open data or RDF which are ostensibly large amorphous graphs may be missing. The challenge here is to find techniques for discovering or adding that structure to provide the necessary basis for citation.

This method evaluation study examined the specificity and sensitivity of 41 MST methodologies by analyzing data generated in 27 laboratories. MST methodologies that targeted human, cow, ruminant, dog, gull, pig, horse, and sheep were tested against sewage, septage, human, cow, dog, deer, pig, chicken, pigeon, gull, horse, and goose fecal samples. Each laboratory received 64 blind samples containing a single source (singletons) or two sources (doubletons), as well as diluted singleton samples to assess method sensitivity. Laboratories utilized their own protocols when performing the methods and data were deposited in a central database before samples were unblinded. Between one and seven laboratories tested each method. The most sensitive and specific assays, based on an analysis of presence/absence of each marker in target and non-target fecal samples, were HF183 endpoint and HF183SYBR (human), CF193 and Rum2Bac (ruminant), CowM2 and CowM3 (cow), BacCan (dog), Gull2SYBR and LeeSeaGull (gull), PF163 and pigmtDNA (pig), HoF597 (horse), PhyloChip (pig, horse, chicken, deer), Universal 16S TRFLP (deer), and Bacteroidales 16S TRFLP (pig, horse, chicken, deer); all had sensitivity and specificity higher than 80% in all or the majority of laboratories. When the abundance of MST markers in target and non-target fecal samples was examined, some assays that performed well in the binary analysis were found to not be sensitive enough as median concentrations fell below a minimum abundance criterion (set at 50 copies per colony forming units of enterococci) in target fecal samples. Similarly, some assays that cross-reacted with non-target fecal sources in the binary analysis were found to perform well in a quantitative analysis because the cross-reaction occurred at very low levels. Based on a quantitative analysis, the best performing methods were HF183Taqman and BacH (human), Rum2Bac and BacR (ruminant), LeeSeaGull (gull), and Pig2Bac (pig); no cow or dog-specific assay met the quantitative specificity and sensitivity criteria. Some of the best performing assays in the study were run by just one laboratory so further testing of assay portability is needed. While this study evaluated the marker performance in defined samples, further field testing as well as development of frameworks for fecal source allocation and risk assessment are needed."

These statistics provide important information for managing rivers, but are often unavailable since most basins are ungauged. A common approach for predicting percentile flows is to deploy regional regression models based on gauged percentile flows and related independent variables derived from physical and climatic data. The first step of this process identifies groups of basins through a cluster analysis of the independent variables, followed by the development of a regression model for each group. This entire process hinges on the independent variables selected to summarize the physical and climatic state of basins. Distributed physical and climatic datasets now exist for the contiguous United States (US). However, it remains unclear how to best represent these data for the development of regional regression models. The study presented here developed regional regression models for the contiguous US, and evaluated the effect of different approaches for selecting the initial set of independent variables on the predictive performance of the regional regression models. An expert assessment of the dominant controls on the FDC was used to identify a small set of independent variables likely related to percentile flows. A data-driven approach was also applied to evaluate two larger sets of variables that consist of either (1) the averages of data for each basin or (2) both the averages and statistical distribution of basin data distributed in space and time. The small set of variables from the expert assessment of the FDC and two larger sets of variables for the data-driven approach were each applied for a regional regression procedure. Differences in predictive performance were evaluated using 184 validation basins withheld from regression model development. The small set of independent variables selected through expert assessment produced similar, if not better, performance than the two larger sets of variables. A parsimonious set of variables only consisted of mean annual precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and baseflow index. Additional variables in the two larger sets of variables added little to no predictive information. Regional regression models based on the parsimonious set of variables were developed using 734 calibration basins, and were converted into a tool for predicting 13 percentile flows in the contiguous US. Supplementary Material for this paper includes an R graphical user interface for predicting the percentile flows of basins within the range of conditions used to calibrate the regression models.

Modal mineralogy, trace element compositions and 187Os/188Os ratios suggest that these peridotites are not cognate or residual to mantle plumes but rather samples of Pacific oceanic lithosphere created at the ridge. Savaii and Tubuai islands lie along a flow line in the Pacific plate, and provide two snapshots (separated by over 40Ma in time) of Pacific mantle that originated in the same region of the East Pacific rise. Tubuai xenoliths exhibit 187Os/188Os from 0.1163 to 0.1304, and Savaii (Samoa) xenoliths span a smaller range from 0.1173 to 0.1284. The 187Os/188Os ratios measured in Tubuai xenoliths are lower than (and show no overlap with) basalts from Tubuai. The 187Os/188Os of the Savaii xenoliths overlap the isotopic compositions of lavas from the island of Savaii, but also extend to lower 187Os/188Os than the lavas. 3He/4He measurements of a subset of the xenoliths range from 2.5 to 6.4Ra for Tubuai and 10.8 to 12.4Ra for Savaii.Like abyssal peridotites and xenoliths from oceanic hotspots that sample the convecting mantle, Os isotopes from the Savaii and Tubuai xenolith suites are relatively unradiogenic, but do not preserve a record of depleted early-formed (Hadean and Archean) mantle domains expected from earlier cycles of ridge-related depletion, continent extraction, or subcontinental lithospheric mantle erosion. The lack of preservation of early-formed, geochemically-depleted Os-isotopic and 142Nd/144Nd domains in the modern convecting mantle contrasts with the preservation of early-formed (early-Hadean) 129Xe/130Xe isotopic heterogeneities in the convecting mantle. This can be explained if the initial isotopic signatures in ReOs and SmNd systems are erased by recycling because the parent and daughter elements are retained in subducting slabs and more efficiently returned to the mantle during subduction than Xe. In this way, early-formed Os and Nd-isotopic heterogeneities could have been overprinted with, and diluted by, younger isotopic signatures. In contrast, preservation of early-formed heterogeneities in the modern convecting mantle is possible for other elements, such as Xe, that are not as efficiently recycled back into the mantle, owing to greater fluid mobility that concentrates such elements in the near-surface. Differing recycling efficiencies for Os, Nd and Xe lead to wide differences in the preservation of Hadean isotopic signatures of these elements in the modern convecting mantle. In general, incompatible elements that are fluid mobile (e.g., Xe) concentrate in surface reservoirs and are more likely to preserve Hadean geochemical signatures in the convecting mantle than compatible elements (e.g., Os) and fluid immobile incompatible elements (e.g., Nd)."

The project site is adjacent to Devereux Slough within UCSBs North Campus Open Space (NCOS) part of the protected 652-acre Ellwood Devereux coastal open space area. Historically the upper Devereux Slough contained significant wetland values with both palustrine and estuarine habitat types and supported more than half of the coastal wetlands within the slough system. In 1965 wetlands in the upper slough were filled to create the Ocean Meadows golf course. Up to 500000 cubic yards of soil were moved from adjacent lands causing severe degradation of the borrow sites and raising the elevation of the lower estuary between four and 10 feet. Filling reduced the flood capacity of the wetland and significantly reduced habitat for estuarine and palustrine dependent wildlife including fish birds insects and mammals of concern (Campopiano et. al 2000). In 2011 and 2013 the State Coastal Conservancy (SCC) received two NCWCP grants for a total of $2 million; $500000 for the acquisition of the Ocean Meadows/Upper Devereux Slough that occurred in 2013 and $1.5 million towards restoration of that wetland to its historic status. The restoration portions of those grants have been combined to fund a portion of Phase 1a of the larger restoration vision for this estuary. This project is for Phase 1b (12 acres) which forms an integrated and integral part of the larger project.

The common approach for atmospheric correction is to use top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) radiance in the near infrared (NIR) or short-wave infrared (SWIR) to select a ‘standard’ aerosol model, and to then use this model to calculate the TOA atmospheric radiance in the visible (VIS). This approach suffers from limitations that severely restrict the accuracy of water-leaving radiance retrievals especially in coastal regions covered by absorbing aerosols. We propose using radiance observations in the near ultra-violet (NUV) and O2 A-band as well as polarized multiangle radiance measurements in the VIS-NIR-SWIR to improve the efficacy of atmospheric correction for remote sensing of coastal waters. We will mostly utilize currently sponsored flights of the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) onboard an ER-2 (high-altitude) aircraft to obtain the requisite NUV and O2 A-band over the coast of California. We will provide the Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP) onboard the ER-2 at minimal cost to obtain the requisite multiangle VIS-NIR- SWIR polarized radiance. We will expand existing inversion algorithms to include these radiance data, and expand our ocean model to include independent variations for underwater-light scattering and absorption. Validation of atmospheric correction results will be performed by comparing the resulting water-leaving radiance with ship-based measurements from the NASA Plumes and Blooms (PnB) ocean color project. We will compare our ocean color retrievals with those retrieved from coincident satellite observations, and perform extensive sensitivity studies, to evaluate the benefits to atmospheric correction of adding NUV radiance, O2 radiance, and multiangle VIS-NIR-SWIR polarized radiance to the common suite of VIS-NIR-SWIR ocean color observations. The proposed research is the first to date to examine in detail and quantify the anticipated improvement in atmospheric correction when such measurements are included. The 169 need for NUV radiance measurements to achieve this objective has been recognized in the recent formulation of threshold requirements for the NASA Pelagic and Coastal Ecosystem (PACE) mission. The PACE mission also advocates the contemporaneous use of multispectral and multiangle polarized radiance and of O2 A-band radiances to improve atmospheric correction. The results of the proposed research will also benefit other planned NASA missions, such as the Geostationary Coastal and Air Pollution Events (GEO-CAPE) and the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) missions, which add UV (and O2) bands and also require improved atmospheric correction algorithms. Analyzing the AVIRIS, RSP and ship based measurements is a highly complex undertaking that requires a multidisciplinary team of specialists. Dr. Chowdhary has worked for over a decade on the simultaneous retrieval of aerosol and ocean properties from RSP measurements. He developed a state-of-the-art radiative transfer program for polarized underwater light, and is a member of the Glory Science Team (GST) and the PACE Science Definition Team (PSDT). Dr. Alexandrov, Dr. van Diedenhoven, and Dr. Knobelspiesse have worked extensively on developing state-of-the-art inversion algorithms for RSP and APS data, and are also members of the GST. Mr. McCubbin has been part of the AVIRIS team at JPL for 15 years, and has extensive flight operation experience with AVIRIS and the ER-2. Dr. Cairns is the instrument scientist for the RSP and APS instruments, a member of the PSDT and the GST, and has overseen analyses of RSP data from all previous field campaigns.

Most ranches in the western US rely upon seasonal grazing access to public lands, and conflict over biodiversity management has led to proposals to restrict grazing access on public lands. We evaluate whether grazing restrictions on public rangelands could have the unintended effect of increasing the conversion of private rangeland to cropland, causing habitat loss for sagegrouse, a species of conservation concern. Using a model parameterized with empirical observations of land use change and ranch versus cropland profitability, we explore how changes to public lands grazing policy could affect ranch profitability and consequently land use on private lands across the western US. We predict that restricting grazing of public lands by 50% would result in the loss of an additional 171,400 ha of sagegrouse habitat on private lands by 2050, on top of the 842,000 ha predicted to be lost under business as usual. Most of this conversion would affect sagegrouse mesic habitat, 75% of which occurs on private land and is vital to the species during brood rearing. Under such policy changes, we estimate that an additional 105,700 ha (3.24%) of sagegrouse mesic habitat held on private land in the study region would be directly lost by 2050, and the cumulative area affected by fragmentation would be much higher. By considering the human and ecological links between public and private land, we show that attempts to improve habitat on public lands via grazing restrictions could result in greater systemwide fragmentation of sagegrouse habitat from unintended habitat loss on private lands. Synthesis and applications. Policy interventions on public lands can affect private landholders. Landholders responses can result in unintended consequences, both for habitat on private land and community support for conservation. Restricting grazing on US public lands is likely to increase habitat loss on private lands and reduce community support for sage grouse conservation. Policy that manages resources on public lands while also supporting sustainable, economically viable ranching operations on private lands is a promising approach to maximizing sage grouse habitat.

Guidelines suggest beams with lengths around 1 m for Extended Column Tests (ECTs) and Propagation Saw Tests (PSTs). To examine how test length affects propagation, we performed 163 ECTs and PSTs 1 to 10 m long. On days with full crack propagation in 1.0 to 1.5 m tests, we then made videos of tests 2 to 10 m long. We inserted markers for particle tracking to measure collapse amplitude, collapse wave speed, and wavelength. We also used a finite element model to simulate the strain energy release rate at fixed crack lengths. We find that: (1) the proportion of tests with full propagation decreased with test length; (2) collapse was greater at the ends of the beams than in the centers; (3) collapse amplitudes in the longer tests were consistent with the shorter tests and did not reach a constant value; (4) collapse wavelengths in the longer tests were around 3 m, 2 greater than what is predicted by the anticrack model. Based on our field tests and FE models, we conclude that the shorter tests fully propagated more frequently because of increased stress concentration from the far edge. The FE model suggests this edge effect occurs for PSTs up to 2 m long or a crack to beam length ratio ‚â• 0.20. Our results suggest that ECT and PST length guidelines may need to be revisited."

In order to manage emerging diseases and predict where emergence will likely occur, it is necessary to understand the factors influencing the distribution, abundance and infection prevalence of vector species. In North America, Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease and is transmitted by blacklegged ticks. This study aimed to explore the abiotic and environmental drivers of density and infection prevalence of western blacklegged ticks (Ixodes pacificus) in southern California, an understudied and densely populated region of North America. RESULTS: Over the course of this two-year study, densities of I. pacificus adults were consistently positively associated with host availability for juvenile ticks and dense oak woodland habitat. Densities of nymphal and larval I. pacificus, on the other hand were primarily predicted by host availability for juvenile ticks in the first year of the study, and by habitat characteristics such as dense leaf litter in the second year. Infection with the causative agent of Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi (sensu stricto), and related spirochetes was not predicted by the abiotic conditions promoting I. pacificus populations, but rather by diversity of the tick community, and in particular by the presence of two Ixodes tick species that do not generally feed on humans (Ixodes spinipalpis and Ixodes peromysci). Borrelia spp. infection was not detected in the I. pacificus populations sampled, but was detected in other vector species that may maintain enzootic transmission of the pathogen on the landscape. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified dense oak woodlands as high-risk habitats for I. pacificus tick encounter in southern California. The shift in relative importance of host availability to habitat characteristics in predicting juvenile tick abundance occurred as Californias historic drought intensified, suggesting that habitat providing suitable microclimates for tick survivorship became centrally important to patterns of abundance in the face of deleterious abiotic conditions. These results underscore the need for further investigation of the effects of climate change on tick-borne disease in California. Finally, despite low risk of human Lyme disease infection posed by I. pacificus in southern California, evidence of infection was found in other tick species, suggesting that enzootic transmission of tick-borne borreliae may be occurring in southern California, and involve parallel enzootic cycles with other tick and host species but not necessarily humans."

Here, models for molten MgSiO3 are computed employing empirical potential molecular dynamics (EPMD) and results are compared to published results including two EPMD studies and three first-principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) models and to laboratory data. The EPMD results derived from the Oganov (OG) potential come closest to the density of MgSiO3 liquid at the 1-bar melting point inferred from the melting curve. At higher P, EPMD densities calculated from the OG potential and FPMD broadly match shock wave studies, with the OG potential yielding the better comparison. Matsui (M) potential results deviate from other studies above º50GPa. Overall, results based on the OG potential compare best to experimental densities over the PT range of the mantle. Isothermally, upon increasing P the mean coordination numbers ( CN ) of oxygen around Si and Mg monotonically increase with pressure. Tetrahedral Si and octahedral Si monotonically increase and decrease, respectively, whereas pentahedral Si maximizes at 1020GPa. Tetrahedral Mg decreases monotonically as P increases whereas pentahedral, octahedral and higher coordination polyhedra each show similar behavior first increasing and then decreasing after attaining a maximum; the P of the maximum for each polyhedra type migrates to higher P as the CN increases. Free oxygen and oxygen with one nearest neighbor of either Si or Mg decreases whereas Si or Mg with two or three nearest oxygens (i.e., tricluster oxygen) increases with increasing P isothermally. The increase of tricluster oxygen is consistent with spectroscopy on MgSiO3 glass quenched from 2000K and 040GPa and high-energy X-ray studies constraining the coordination of O around Mg and around Si at 2300K and 1bar. Coordination statistics from FPMD studies for O around Si and Si around O are in agreement with the EPMD results based on the M and OG potentials. Mg self-diffusivity is greater than O and Si self-diffusivities for both the M and OG potentials. All D values monotonically decrease with increasing pressure isothermally and all atoms are more diffusive in the M liquid compared to the OG liquid except at T >º5000K and P >100GPa. Previously published EPMD diffusivities fall between values given by the M and OG potentials, at least up to 45GPa. The M liquid is generally less viscous than the OG liquid except at P >º80GPa. Activation energy and volume are around 96kJ/mol and 1.5cm3/mol, respectively. The FPMD viscosity results at 120GPa and 4000 and 4500K are essentially identical to the values from the M and OG potentials. FPMD viscosity results are similar to the OG results for P <60GPa; at higher P, the FPMD viscosities are higher. At 4000K and 100GPa the shear viscosity of liquid MgSiO3 is º0.1Pas. More extensive laboratory results are required to better define the thermodynamic, transport and structural properties of MgSiO3 liquids and for comparison with computational studies."

The site was owned and operated by Casmalia Resources and accepted approximately 5.6 billion pounds of waste between 1973 and 1989. Waste disposal units at the site included: 6 landfills for pesticides/solvents metals caustic/cyanides acids and non-liquid polychlorinated biphenyls; 43 surface impoundments; 15 evaporation pads; 2 non-hazardous waste spreading areas; 6 oil field spreading areas; 11 shallow injection wells; 7 disposal trenches; 1 drum burial unit; and 6 landfills. The site supports five stormwater ponds that may serve as an attractive nuisance to wildlife. The federally endangered California tiger salamander (Ambystoma californiense) and federally threatened Calfornia red-legged frog (Rana draytonii) have been detected at the site. In 2001 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) entered into an agreement with EPA to extend a covenant not to sue for Natural Resource Damages to potentially responsible parties as part of a de minimis settlement. The Service received $178250 in settlement funds in exchange for the issuance of the covenant not to sue. The Service intends to use these funds to conduct restoration that will benefit the California red-legged frog California tiger salamander and other trust resources. Biological surveys were conducted in the late 1990s and early 2000s in support of EPAs ecological risk assessment and remedial investigation. Updated surveys are necessary in order to determine current usage of the site by our trust resources and to best guide the use of the limited settlement dollars available to conduct restoration. The Ventura Fish and Wildlife Office proposes to use the requested funding to conduct surveys for the California red-legged frog and California tiger salamander in strategic locations within the site and surrounding habitats to determine current usage of the site by these species. Surveys for California red-legged frogs were previously conducted in 1998 1999 2001 2002 2003 and 2004. Surveys for California tiger salamanders were conducted in 2002/2003 and 2004/2005. California red-legged frogs were detected in all survey efforts with the exception of 2004. California tiger salamanders were detected during drift fence surveys in 2004/2005. Because California tiger salamander surveys have never been replicated at the site in the six years since the species was detected and because the species is so acutely imperiled within Santa Barbara County information about presence or absence of the species at the Casmalia Resources site would be invaluable. In addition previous surveys for California tiger salamanders established presence of metamorphosed individuals in upland habitat but the extent of California tiger salamander breeding in aquatic resources at the site remains unknown. The trend in observations of California red-legged frogs throughout the 1998 to 2004 study period demonstrated a rapid decline from over 50 individuals detected in 1998 to no individuals detected in 2003 or 2004. The absence of California red-legged frogs in 2003 and 2004 is suspected to be associated with low water levels in the stormwater ponds due to pumping of water for the construction of a landfill cap and increasing total dissolved solids (TDS) in the stormwater ponds. The water level in all ponds is currently high relative to 2003/2004 however TDS remains high and the use of the ponds by California red-legged frogs and California tiger salamanders is unknown. It is likely that the high TDS is creating an attractive nuisance for the California tiger salamanders and California red-legged frogs attempting to breed at the site. This project will evaluate the need for (through aquatic and upland surveys) and feasibility of creating additional breeding ponds at the site to provide suitable breeding habitat away from areas with high TDS. Ponds will subsequently be created as deemed appropriate and monitored in subsequent years. The proposed surveys will assist the Service in providing technical assistance to EPA during the remedial process and implementing restoration for the California red-legged frog and California tiger salamander. Updated information about the use of the site by California tiger salamanders and California red-legged frogs will support the Services effort to work with EPA in evaluating and selecting a remedy that would provide maximum habitat for trust resources and understand the use of the site be these species. The study will be conducted in phases to achieve the overall objectives of the study.

As a consequence, lidar-derived information has led to fundamental discoveries within the individual disciplines of geomorphology, hydrology, and ecology. These disciplines form the cornerstones of critical zone (CZ) science, where researchers study how interactions among the geosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere shape and maintain the zone of life, which extends from the top of unweathered bedrock to the top of the vegetation canopy. Fundamental to CZ science is the development of transdisciplinary theories and tools that transcend disciplines and inform others work, capture new levels of complexity, and create new intellectual outcomes and spaces. Researchers are just beginning to use lidar data sets to answer synergistic, transdisciplinary questions in CZ science, such as how CZ processes co-evolve over long timescales and interact over shorter timescales to create thresholds, shifts in states and fluxes of water, energy, and carbon. The objective of this review is to elucidate the transformative potential of lidar for CZ science to simultaneously allow for quantification of topographic, vegetative, and hydrological processes. A review of 147 peer-reviewed lidar studies highlights a lack of lidar applications for CZ studies as 38 % of the studies were focused in geomorphology, 18 % in hydrology, 32 % in ecology, and the remaining 12 % had an interdisciplinary focus. A handful of exemplar transdisciplinary studies demonstrate lidar data sets that are well-integrated with other observations can lead to fundamental advances in CZ science, such as identification of feedbacks between hydrological and ecological processes over hillslope scales and the synergistic co-evolution of landscape-scale CZ structure due to interactions amongst carbon, energy, and water cycles. We propose that using lidar to its full potential will require numerous advances, including new and more powerful open-source processing tools, exploiting new lidar acquisition technologies, and improved integration with physically based models and complementary in situ and remote-sensing observations. We provide a 5-year vision that advocates for the expanded use of lidar data sets and highlights subsequent potential to advance the state of CZ science."
35,36.0,0.6323,"population, growth, individual, effect, level, dynamic, rate, size, dispersal, condition",Collaborative Research: Demographic heterogeneity in landscapes and communities Variation in phenotypic traits occurs within all populations. This in turn creates variation in demo- graphic traits — the propensity to survive more or less or to have more or fewer offspring (contrast with the actual life history an organism experiences — its demographic fate; see Kendall & Fox 2003) as well as individual growth and dispersal rates. While ecologists do use models (like linear matrix models) that classify individuals by age stage or size and sex most assume that in doing so they have captured suffi- cient variation so that further variation is simply noise of small amplitude. This is not necessarily the case. This variation in traits occurs even when within categories such as age stage size or sex. We use the term demographic heterogeneity to refer collectively to the variation in birth death growth and dispersal rates among individuals in an age stage or size class. Demographic heterogeneity can be produced by various mechanisms including genetic variabil- ity(Yashin et al. 1999 Ducrocq et al. 2000 Gerdes et al. 2000 Casellas et al. 2004 Isberg et al. 2006)spatial heterogeneity in the habitat(Gates and Gysel 1978 Boulding and Van Alstyne 1993 Menge et al. 1994 Winter et al. 2000 Franklin et al. 2000 Manolis et al. 2002 Bollinger and Gavin 2004 Landis et al. 2005) unequal allocation of parental care(e.g. Johnstone 2004; Manser&Avey 2000) seed heter- omorphisims(e.g. Silvertown 1984; Venable &Burquez M 1990) maternal family effect (Fox et al. 2006) learned feeding preferences (Bolnick et al. 2003) and social rank (e.g. von Holst Hutzelmeyer &Kaetzke 2002). Demographic heterogeneity is taxonomically widespread. For example heterogeneity in survival has been found in crocodiles (Isberg et al. 2006) baboons (Bronikowski et al. 2002) birds (Wintrebert et al. 2005 Fox et al. 2006) wild plants (Beckage and Clark 2003 Landis et al. 2005) domestic ani- mals(Ducrocq et al. 2000 Casellas et al. 2004) and humans(Yashin et al. 1999 Garibotti et al. 2006) including British aristocrats(Doblhammer and Oeppen 2003). Demographic heterogeneity has been shown to have a variety of effects on population dynamics. Heterogeneity in survival and reproduction can change the population variabliltydue to demographic sto- chasticity often reducing it relative to a homogeneous population with the same average rates. Hetero- geneity in survival if it persists throughout the life cycle creates cohort selection which in turn increases the asymptotic population growth rate and equilibrium population densities. Finally heterogeneity in dispersal ability can increase the rate at which an invading population spreads.

These domains provide unique insights into the thermal and structural history of the Mesozoic to Cenozoic Eurasian plate margin, which are critical to inform the initial boundary conditions (e.g. crustal thickness, structure and thermomechanical properties) for the subsequent development of the large and hot TibetanHimalaya orogen, and the associated crustal deformation processes. Using a combination of microstructural analyses, thermobarometry modelling and UThPb monazite and LuHf garnet geochronology, the study reappraises the metamorphic history of exposed midcrustal metapelites in the Chitral region of the South PamirHindu Kush (NW Pakistan). This study also demonstrates that trace elements in monazite (especially Y and Dy), combined with thermodynamical modelling and LuHf garnet dating, provides a powerful integrated toolbox for constraining longlived and polyphased tectonometamorphic histories in all their spatial and temporal complexity. Rocks from the Chitral region were progressively deformed and metamorphosed at sub and suprasolidus conditions through at least four distinct episodes from the Mesozoic to the Cenozoic. Rocks were first metamorphosed at ~400500 C and ~0.3 GPa in the Late TriassicEarly Jurassic (210185 Ma), likely in response to the accretion of the Karakoram during the Cimmerian orogeny. Pressure and temperature subsequently increased by ~0.3 GPa and 100 C in the Early to Mid Cretaceous (14080 Ma), coinciding with the intrusion of calcalkaline granitic plutons across the Karakoram and Pamir regions. This event is interpreted as the record of crustal thickening and the development of a protoplateau within the Eurasian margin due to a longlived episode of slab flattening in an Andeantype margin. Peak metamorphism was reached in the Late EoceneEarly Oligocene (4030 Ma) at conditions of 580600 C and ~0.6 GPa and 700750 C and 0.70.8 GPa for the investigated staurolite schists and sillimanite migmatites respectively. This crustal heating up to moderate anatexis likely resulted in the underthrusting of the Indian plate after a NeoTethyan slabbreak off or to the Tethyan HimalayaLhasa microcontinent collision and subsequent oceanic slab flattening. Nearisothermal decompression/exhumation followed in the Late Oligocene (2823 Ma) as marked by a pressure decrease in excess of ~0.1 GPa. This event was coeval with the intrusion of the 24 Ma Garam Chasma leucogranite. This rapid exhumation is interpreted to be related to the reactivation of the South PamirKarakoram suture zone during the ongoing collision with India. The findings of this study confirm that significant crustal shortening and thickening of the south Eurasian margin occurred during the Mesozoic in an accretionarytype tectonic setting through successive episodes of terrane accretions and probably slab flattening, transiently increasing the coupling at the plate interface. Moreover, they indicate that the south Eurasian margin was already hot and thickened prior to Cenozoic collision with India, which has important implications for orogenscale strainaccommodation mechanisms."

Quantifying bedrock characteristics at hillslope scales, however, has proven difficult. Here, we present a new field-based method for quantifying the depth and apparent density of bedrock fractures within the shallow subsurface based on seismic refraction surveys. We examine variations in subsurface fracture patterns in both Fiordland and the Southern Alps of New Zealand to better constrain the influence of bedrock properties in governing rates and patterns of landslides, as well as the morphology of threshold landscapes. We argue that intense tectonic deformation produces uniform bedrock fracturing with depth, whereas geomorphic processes produce strong fracture gradients focused within the shallow subsurface. Additionally, we argue that hillslope strength and stability are functions of both the intact rock strength and the density of bedrock fractures, such that for a given intact rock strength, a threshold fracture-density exists that delineates between stable and unstable rock masses. In the Southern Alps, tectonic forces have pervasively fractured intrinsically weak rock to the verge of instability, such that the entire rock mass is susceptible to failure and landslides can potentially extend to great depths. Conversely, in Fiordland, tectonic fracturing of the strong intact rock has produced fracture densities less than the regional stability threshold. Therefore, bedrock failure in Fiordland generally occurs only after geomorphic fracturing has further reduced the rock mass strength. This dependence on geomorphic fracturing limits the depths of bedrock landslides to within this geomorphically weakened zone."

In order to achieve carbon neutrality, it is important to understand direct and indirect carbon emissions generated by WWTPs. Here, we focused on electricity use in WWTPs as it is a major source of carbon emissions. Specifically, we compared the electricity intensity and associated carbon emissions of WWTPs in four countries: the USA, Germany, China, and South Africa. We found that 100% energy self-sufficient WWTPs are feasible by a combination of increased energy efficiency and energy harvesting from the wastewater. Carbon emissions of WWTPs depend strongly on the electricity fuel mix, wastewater treatment technologies, treatment capacity, and influent and effluent water quality. A few WWTPs operating in developed countries (USA and Germany) have already achieved almost 100% (or higher) electricity self-sufficiency through energy efficiency and harvesting biogas and electricity. In comparison with Germany, WWTPs in the USA are more heterogeneous and the range of unit carbon emission intensity is much wider. In some areas where the organic content in wastewater is lower and less biogas is produced, it is still possible to achieve energy self-sufficiency by using thermal energy from wastewater. Industrial wastewater in China in general consumes more electricity and the carbon intensity of electricity is also higher, resulting in much higher unit carbon emissions as compared with other countries. In megacities such as Shanghai, larger capacity of centralized WWTPs can decrease the unit carbon emissions significantly. These findings provide a global perspective on the state of WWTPs and are helpful to improve the understanding, designing and operating of WWTPs from the perspective of achieving carbon neutrality."

A field experiment near Bwindi National Park, Uganda Decentralization and community-driven development intend to bring public decisions closer to the people, yet elites often capture local institutions. One way that local elites capture community-driven development is to limit information about opportunities for citizens to shape group decisions. We investigate whether sending citizens targeted and timely information about when and how they can participate in the planning of community-driven development projects increases knowledge, participation, and satisfaction with local institutions. We implemented a pre-registered randomized field experiment in partnership with the Uganda Wildlife Authority that involved sending residents in randomly selected villages near Bwindi National Park approximately 60 messages by mobile phone over eight months about how a park-sponsored revenue sharing program worked and how and when residents could participate. We do not find evidence that the information increased perceived knowledge, participation, perceived efficacy, or satisfaction with local institutions. Exploratory findings suggest that among women, who are often disenfranchised in Ugandan society, the information treatment backfired related to perceived opportunities to participate. More positively, we find that reaching more people in a community with information led to promising results related to participation and satisfaction with the park. We conclude that informational treatments are unlikely to empower participation on average, unless they are deployed broadly and in ways that promote collective action."
40,41.0,0.4809,"rate, sediment, erosion, landscape, basin, erosion_rate, slope, evolution, topography, incision",Collaborative Research: Orogeny orography and unsteady erosion: evolution of the Himalaya Many aspects of climate-erosion-tectonic interactions remain unresolved. This research attempts to understand how Himalayan rates of erosion vary as a function of space and time and what drives such changes. Some detrital cooling-age data suggest that irrespective of how spatially irregular erosion may be at short time scales erosion rates become much steadier at longer time scales. This research will test that contention. The PIs hypothesize that at decadal to millennial scales spatial variations in rainfall distributions modulate differences in erosion rates. Specific stream power (the product of discharge and channel gradient) is hypothesized to provide a reliable proxy for modern erosion rates. To underpin tests of these hypotheses the PIs have developed and calibrated the highest resolution remotely sensed data on rainfall currently available for the Himalaya. When combined with digital topography rainfall is routed through the Himalayan landscape and predicts pronounced along-strike variations in stream power. To test whether stream power successfully predicts variations in erosion rates the PIs will collect 50 detrital cosmogenic nuclide samples within 10 catchments that exhibit strong contrasts in stream power. With judicious placement of sampling sites this large new data set should also permit testing of a much-debated question: is the rate of erosion controlled by large trunk rivers or by the erosive power of much smaller catchments (<20 km2) that cover most of the landscape? In order to assess the extent to which erosion rates change at longer time scales the PIs will collect relief transects of bedrock samples in each of the CRN-sampled catchments and will measure ~100 cooling ages each for apatite zircon and muscovite representing closure temperatures of ~80° ~200° and ~375°C respectively. Reflecting different times and depths of cooling these ages will be analyzed using thermokinematic models to create reliable reconstructions of temporal changes in erosion rates at each of 10 catchments. Furthermore the PIs current analysis suggests that topographic relief exerts a fundamental control on the distribution of Himalayan rainfall and that valleys of large rivers guide moisture into the orogen. At time scales for which Himalayan topography and climate are constant spatial variations in rainfall stream power and hence erosion are therefore envisioned to remain steady. The Himalayas however are an active collisional orogen in which rocks advect laterally faster than they move vertically. The PIs hypothesize that topography also advects laterally especially in the rain shadow north of the Himalayan peaks where erosion rates appear lower. Moreover this advection is hypothesized to cause major re-organization of Himalayan drainages and related topography. If so new avenues for rainfall to move into the orogen will open old ones will close and as a consequence new patterns of erosion should emerge. As advection leads to stream capture and creation of new Transhimalayan rivers with greatly enhanced erosive power other trunk channels will be beheaded thereby losing power. Such changes in stream power should be expressed by changes in both erosion rates and topographic relief. The PIs propose to test these novel ideas by reconstructing changes in topographic relief using bedrock cooling ages both from their relief transects and from equal-elevation transects. Such dynamic Transhimalayan channels would stand in contrast to the persistence of rivers at the Himalayan indentor corners. Despite the challenges presented by Himalayan landscapes they provide a propitious setting: stark lateral variations exist in rainfall erosion and topography; cooling ages are almost ubiquitously reset and strong signals of differential erosion should rise above the inevitable geomorphic and tectonic noise
41,42.0,0.3793,"change, climate, climate_change, response, impact, future, ecosystem, scenario, global, shift","What is the importance of climate model bias when projecting the impacts of climate change on land surface processes? Regional climate change impact (CCI) studies have widely involved downscaling and bias correcting (BC) global climate model (GCM)-projected climate for driving land surface models. However, BC may cause uncertainties in projecting hydrologic and biogeochemical responses to future climate due to the impaired spatiotemporal covariance of climate variables and a breakdown of physical conservation principles. Here we quantify the impact of BC on simulated climate-driven changes in water variables (evapotranspiration (ET), runoff, snow water equivalent (SWE), and water demand for irrigation), crop yield, biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC), nitric oxide (NO) emissions, and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) export over the Pacific Northwest (PNW) region. We also quantify the impacts on net primary production (NPP) over a small watershed in the region (HJ-Andrews). Simulation results from the coupled ECHAM5MPI-OM model with A1B emission scenario were first dynamically downscaled to 12 km resolution with the WRF model. Then a quantile-mapping-based statistical downscaling model was used to downscale them into 1/16 resolution daily climate data over historical and future periods. Two climate data series were generated, with bias correction (BC) and without bias correction (NBC). Impact models were then applied to estimate hydrologic and biogeochemical responses to both BC and NBC meteorological data sets. These impact models include a macroscale hydrologic model (VIC), a coupled cropping system model (VIC-CropSyst), an ecohydrological model (RHESSys), a biogenic emissions model (MEGAN), and a nutrient export model (Global-NEWS). Results demonstrate that the BC and NBC climate data provide consistent estimates of the climate-driven changes in water fluxes (ET, runoff, and water demand), VOCs (isoprene and monoterpenes) and NO emissions, mean crop yield, and river DIN export over the PNW domain. However, significant differences rise from projected SWE, crop yield from dry lands, and HJ-Andrewss ET between BC and NBC data. Even though BC post-processing has no significant impacts on most of the studied variables when taking PNW as a whole, their effects have large spatial variations and some local areas are substantially influenced. In addition, there are months during which BC and NBC post-processing produces significant differences in projected changes, such as summer runoff. Factor-controlled simulations indicate that BC post-processing of precipitation and temperature both substantially contribute to these differences at regional scales. We conclude that there are trade-offs between using BC climate data for offline CCI studies versus directly modeled climate data. These trade-offs should be considered when designing integrated modeling frameworks for specific applications; for example, BC may be more important when considering impacts on reservoir operations in mountainous watersheds than when investigating impacts on biogenic emissions and air quality, for which VOCs are a primary indicator."

The borehole program is highly leveraged taking advantage of the resources of other programs and agencies that are active in monitoring southern California earthquake activity. This data is made available online to the public and research community. The SCEC borehole data gathering effort is contributing to the overall scientific goals of the SCEC collaboratory. For example the borehole data available online at the SCEDC and at IRIS from the SCEC/PBO stations in the Anza region are providing a unique new high-resolution data set for analysis of earthquake source parameters (Priority A4) as well as providing observations of non-volcanic tremor induced events in the region following large regional and very large global earthquakes. In addition the borehole instrumentation is critical to improving our understanding of nonlinear effects and to developing methodologies to include these effects into ground motion simulations (Priority B4 B5). As has been the case for many years joint monitoring efforts continue between SCEC and the US Geological Survey and Caltech through ANSS NSMP and CISN and the California Geological Survey to maintain the existing network of borehole stations. Other collaborators include the NSF funded NEES and HPWREN programs as well as a newly funded NSF project to look at the San Jacinto Fault zone including the installation of additional borehole sensors. In 2011 SCEC borehole stations will continue to be upgraded along with the CISN network stations in southern California. This includes migration to new datalogger technology and the upgrade of surface sensors. As the SCEC borehole stations come up on the schedule for network wide upgrades we will continue to work with the SCSN field technicians during the upgrade process. The SCEC borehole program will also continue the collaboration with the NEES program (Priority B6) through processing and data dissemination of the SCEC borehole data; the SCEC/EarthScope Plate Boundary Observatory borehole strainmeter program that includes both weak- and strong-motion seismic monitoring in the Anza region; and the strong-motion borehole sensors being installed as part of a new NSF funded study of the San Jacinto fault zone.
43,44.0,0.6278,"management, fishery, fish, specie, marine, mpa, potential, connectivity, benefit, reserve",MPA-Based Collaborative Techniques to Improve Management of Nearshore Fisheries Spatially structured data poor stocks are among the most valuable fisheries in California. Effective management of these stocks is suboptimal due to the lack of stock status indicators and unknown quantitative reference points. Stock assessments are the basic framework for computing stock status indicators yet many nearshore species lack the necessary data to perform traditional stock assessments. Moreover many stocks in the nearshore environment are governed by metapopulation dynamics (Gunderson et al. 2006) in which discrete populations are connected via larval dispersal (Kritzer and Sale 2004). For these species traditional coast-wide assessments are insufficient to account for differences in mortality rates growth rates reproductive patterns and harvest pressure between sub populations (Francis et al. 2008) thus reducing the potential to set harvest levels at predetermined target levels. The spiny lobster (Panulirus interruptus) is an economically culturally and ecologically important species in California. During the 2007-08 fishing season for example 167 active commercial permits landed 306t (metric) with an ex- vessel value of ~$7.22 million. A vigorous recreational fishery is also formed around this species and initial analyses of recreational report cards issued by the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) suggest that this sector contributes significantly to the total catch. In December of 2009 the authors participated in a workshop convened by CDFG that outlined needs and objectives for completion of a stock assessment by December 2010. Stock assessment biologists and independent consultants (Marine Stewardship Council) have determined that estimates of fishing mortality natural mortality and growth rates are critical to performing a robust assessment of the spiny lobster resource. Californias nearshore finfish fishery targets multiple species using hook-and-line and trap gear. Although the total statewide volume of commercial landings in the nearshore groundfish fishery has been modest in recent years (224 tons landed commercially in California waters in 2006) many of theA(and net revenues of $2.2 million in 2006). Grass rockfish (Sebastes rastrelliger) is one of the predominantly landed stocks of the 19 species managed under the Nearshore Fisheries Management Plan (Nearshore FMP 2002). Sufficient data to evaluate stock status of grass rockfish and a majority of the other species in the Nearshore FMP are unavailable and therefore the complex is managed using the precautionary approach (Restrepo et al. 1998). The Reauthorization of the Magnuson Act now requires the setting of Annual Catch Limits (ACLs) for all US fisheries. To effectively set ACLs novel methods must be developed and utilized for these data poor species. The implementation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) along the California coast (MLPA) offers tremendous potential for managers to use these zones to guide decision making at local scales. No-take MPAs may serve as proxies for unfished populations at specific locations. By comparing MPAs to adjacent fished areas that experience similar environmental conditions it may be possible to calculate natural mortality and fishing mortality rates as well as design methods that set sustainable harvest levels at local scales. We have developed two novel methods for utilizing data from MPAs to inform fisheries management decisions for the nearshore and spiny lobster fisheries: (1) A decision tree model (Wilson et al. 2010) that can be used to set ACLs and (2) a length structured model that uses growth models and size structure data from inside and outside reserves to calculate rates of natural and fishery- imposed mortality. For spiny lobster the growth and mortality models developed in this proposal and the resulting outputs will be directly utilized in the upcoming stock assessment being performed by Doug Neilson of CDFG. We are in direct contact with Dr. Neilson and he has expressed a need for these data as soon as possible thus the urgency of this research is immediate. The decision tree-ACL model developed in this proposal and the recommended harvest levels for grass rockfish will be published in peer reviewed journals with the expectation of becoming a tool in the CDFG and NOAA Fisheries toolbox for setting ACLs which is also of immediate urgency. NOAA and CDFG stock assessment biologists with whom we collaborate (Alec MacCall NOAA Meisha Key CDFG) have expressed confidence that the decision tree- ACL model will be an accurate and practical tool for setting catch limits.
44,45.0,0.5964,"earthquake, fault, rupture, frequency, seismic, ground_motion, source, dynamic, large, velocity",Strong Ground Motions in Salt Lake City and Other Metropolitan Areas From Large Earthquakes on the Wasatch Fault Nearly 80% of the population of Utah lives near the Wasatch fault (Utah Geological Survey 1996). The metropolitan areas of Salt Lake City and Provo/Orem are among the most hazardous regions of the United States (USGS 1998). Besides the question: When will the next large earthquake occur? The most important question is: What will the ground motion be? Large earthquakes even moderate sized events are relatively rare on the Wasatch fault. The geological settingwhere most of the infrastructure and the population are sitting on alluvial filled valleys exacerbates the situation. We propose to mitigate the seismic risk by using dynamic and kinematic simulations of different earthquake scenarios to derive estimates of the expected ground motion from large earthquakes on the Wasatch fault. These simulations will account for: 1) geometry of the fault 2) the velocity structure in particular the 3D structure with sediments juxtaposed against the granite of the mountains 3) topography 4) heterogeneous stress on the fault and 5) physics of the constitutive laws for friction. Many different earthquake scenarios based on different hypocenters and variations of the input parameters will be simulated in order to determine the range of the ground motion. These simulations will provide ground motion for frequencies up to 1-2 Hz. We will make use of the extensive investigations already done for the Wasatch fault that document the geometry of the fault active tectonics and the velocity and attenuation structure. Recent USGS funded projects will provide more details about the 3D velocity structure as well as the near-surface velocities for some limited regions. Professor Robert Smith University of Utah has been either directly or indirectly involved with most of the studies that provide these basic data. We have used the 3D community velocity model and the USGS description of the fault geometry as the baseline for our simulations. We have incorporated these features in our initial simulations of the dynamics of a spontaneously propagating fracture. We use the finite element code MAFE [Ma and Beroza 2008; Ma and Archuleta 2006; Ma et al. 2007] to simulate dynamic ruptures on dipping faults. The dynamics includes heterogeneous stress conditions and a slip weakening constitutive law for friction that couples the heterogeneous stresses on the fault with the elastic response during a spontaneous shear fracture. While this method includes the realistic effects of geology fault structure and the physics of a spontaneously propagating shear fracture the ground motion is computationally limited to frequencies less than 1-2 Hz. To extend the frequency range to higher frequencies ~10-20 Hz we will collaborate with Professor Jacobo Bielak Carnegie Mellon University who has developed a hierarchical finite element method that can take our dynamic results of faulting as input to a kinematic model and propagate the motion to higher frequencies. With many different faulting scenarios there will be many different ground motion maps. The purpose of the project is to estimate the range of ground motion that should be expected from a MW ~7 earthquake on the Wasatch Fault. Preliminary results for normal faulting earthquakes show that the ground motion on the hanging wall (the side of the fault where most of population resides) has large ground motion and long duration due both to the proximity of the fault plane and the sediment filled basin. The largest amplitudes are within ¬±5 km of the fault trace with the largest amplitudes on the vertical component. Basically we have very limited direct knowledge of what to expect from a large normal-faulting earthquake. Through simulations of many scenario earthquakes that include realistic geological structure and fault geometries we will provide robust estimates for the expected ground motion from a MW~7 earthquake on the Wasatch fault.
45,46.0,0.5384,"map, base, resolution, image, mapping, accuracy, spectral, index, error, sensor","Hierarchical Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) of hyperspectral imagery for urban environments Remote sensing has considerable potential for providing accurate, up-to-date information in urban areas. Urban remote sensing is complicated, however, by very high spectral and spatial complexity. In this paper, Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) was applied to map urban land cover using HyMap data acquired over the city of Bonn, Germany. MESMA is well suited for urban environments because it allows the number and types of endmembers to vary on a per-pixel basis, which allows controlling the large spectral variability in these environments. We employed a hierarchical approach, in which MESMA was applied to map four levels of complexity ranging from the simplest level consisting of only two classes, impervious and pervious, to 20 classes that differentiated material composition and plant species. Lower levels of complexity, mapped at the highest accuracies, were used to constrain spatially models at higher levels of complexity, reducing spectral confusion between materials. A spectral library containing 1521 endmembers was created from the HyMap data. Three endmember selection procedures, Endmember Average RMS (EAR), Minimum Average Spectral Angle (MASA) and Count Based Endmember Selection (COB), were used to identify the most representative endmembers for each level of complexity. Combined two-, three- or four-endmember models depending on the hierarchical level were applied, and the highest endmember fractions were used to assign a land cover class. Classification accuracies of 97.2% were achieved for the two lowest complexity levels, consisting of impervious and pervious classes, and a four class map consisting of vegetation, bare soil, water and built-up. At the next level of complexity, consisting of seven classes including trees, grass, bare soil, river, lakes/basins, road and roof/building, classification accuracies remained high at 81.7% with most classes mapped above 85% accuracy. At the highest level, consisting of 20 land cover classes, a 75.9% classification accuracy was achieved. The ability of MESMA to incorporate within-class spectral variability, combined with a hierarchical approach that uses spatial information from one level to constrain model selection at a higher level of complexity was shown to be particularly well suited for urban environments."
