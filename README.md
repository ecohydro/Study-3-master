# Designing Multi-Level Spatial Views of Research Themes
The goal of this project is to model research themes studied at UC Santa Barbara's Earth Research Institute [ERI](https://www.eri.ucsb.edu/) and map their evolution over the past decade. Our motivation is to complement quantitative, scientometric approaches typically used to review bodies of research with qualitative, systematic approaches. We first produce topic models from ERI's research documents and then use the models to map themes from the body of research. The maps offer spatial views of ERI's research at multiple levels of thematic granularity.

## Data sources
We analyze funded projects and publications from ERI's **240** principal investigators (PIs) active from **2009 - 2019**. ERI maintains records of active PIs and funded projects. We gather PI publication metadata from the [Dimensions API](https://www.dimensions.ai/). Only funded projects or publications with titles and abstracts are analyzed, resulting in **3,770** research documents (3,108 publications and 662 funded projects). 

## Natural Language Processing
We prepare the documents (titles and abstracts) for topic modeling by removing records with identical identifiers (DOIs), removing HTML tags, and reformatting ASCII extended characters. Documents range in length from 128 - 7,083 characters; the mean document length is 1,678 characters.

We determine distinct document terms using the measure of term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency (Salton et al., 1975). From these frequent terms, we select generic terms that qualify as stopwords and strip them from the documents. The 20 most distinctive (and possibly important) words in the documents, along with their relative weights, are:

01. species (53.78)
02. water (53.24)
03. climate (49.46)
04. model (46.09)
05. soil (42.27)
06. snow (37.30)
07. change (36.95)
08. high (35.48)
09. surface (34.62)
10. based (33.88)
11. models (32.29)
12. ocean (30.01)
13. carbon (29.92)
14. results (29.59)
15. spatial (29.49)
16. environmental (29.20)
17. global (29.00)
18. land (28.74)
19. california (28.43)
20. time (28.08)

Next, we follow a standard natural language processing pipeline (Boyd-Graber et al., 2014) to reformat the documents into a dictionary and a corpus: 

1. extension of the stopword list to remove frequent, generic terms determined by tf-idf ('data', 'study', 'project', 'research', 'collaborative', 'include', 'result', 'increase', 'high', 'low', 'large', 'include', 'based');
2. tokenization, conversion to lowercase, and construction of n-gram models (bigrams, trigrams) to preserve contiguous sequences of words (e.g. 'climate_change'); 
3. and lemmatization to resolve words to their base forms (e.g. 'specie') 

From the processed documents, we create a dictionary (of word ids, word frequencies) and a corpus (a bag of words shown as a wordcloud below) to use in topic modeling.

## Topic Modeling
We experiment with two kinds of topic modeling approaches: *probabilistic* (LDA, hLDA) and *matrix factorization* (NMF). In probabilistic approaches, each document is treated as a mixture of a small number of topics; words and documents get a probability score for each topic (Blei, 2003). In matrix factorization approaches, methods from linear algebra are applied to decompose a document-term matrix (tf-idf) into a smaller set of matrices, which can be interpreted as a topic model (Lee and Seung, 1999). We report *coherence scores* for the topic models, which allow model comparison and evaluation across levels of thematic granularity. Coherence measures the extent to which top terms representing a topic are semantically related relative to the corpus (Mimno et al., 2011). This measure allows us to select a model with a number of topics yielding a relatively high coherence score.  

### Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
The LDA algorithm (Blei et al., 2003) is a generative probabilistic model. In each run of LDA, we set the random seed to 1, ensuring model reproducibility. The [MALLET](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu./) implementation of LDA produced higher quality topics than the Gensim and Scikit-learn implementations. We tested 2 - 100 topics based on the previously established heuristics and iterated through these to determine models yielding the highest coherence scores. Following our heuristics, the model with the highest coherence score in the first level of thematic granularity (between 5 - 9 topics) has **8 topics** and the model with the highest coherence score in the second level (between 25 - 81 topics) has **43 topics**. The findings are summarized below.

<img src="figures/LDA-coherence-V2.png" alt="LDA-coherence" width="500"/>

| Number of Topics| Coherence Score (0 - 1) | 
|-------------:|-------------:|
| **43** | **0.5444**  |
| 47 |0.5376 | 
| 55 |0.5347  | 
| 67 |0.5330 | 
| 52 |0.5328 | 
| **8** | **0.4657** | 
| 9|0.462| 
| 7 |0.4576 | 
| 5|0.4317  | 
| 6|0.4292 | 

We produce interfaces to the topic models using [pyLDAvis](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bmabey/pyLDAvis/blob/master/notebooks/pyLDAvis_overview.ipynb). The browser-based tool offers an interactive visualization of topics estimated with LDA. The distance between topics (Jensen-Shannon divergence) is computed; multidimensional scaling (principal components) projects the intertopic distances onto two dimensions. The size of topics and their distributions, as well as the saliency of terms within each topic and across the entire corpus, are visible. As a result, pyLDAvis supports interpretation of the meaning of each topic; the prevalence of each topic; and the relationships among topics.

### Hierarchical LDA (hLDA)

An extension of LDA for learning topic hierarchies is hLDA (Griffiths et al., 2004). This approach estimates the structure of a hierarchy and partitions documents nonparametrically. We implement hLDA with [Tomotopy](https://bab2min.github.io/tomotopy). The following summarizes our findings at several hierarchical levels. The hierarchical model with a depth of 4 has the lowest perplexity score, which measures how well a probability model predicts a sample for a given number of topics. 

The model producing the lowest perplexity score is the **4-level** hierarchical model. The first level for all models has 1 parent topic. Interpreting the number of topics using our heuristics, the second level of the 4-level model has 29 topics, which is within the suitable range of topics that we predicted (25 - 81). Extending Miller's Law to a third and fourth level, a suitable range of topics for each would fall between ((5 x 5 x 5) to (9 x 9 x 9)) and ((5 x 5 x 5 x 5) to (9 x 9 x 9 x 9)) respectively. Neither the third nor fourth levels however fall within these wide predicted ranges; 83 topics (125 - 729) and 409 topics (625 - 6561). The findings from hierarchical models between 3 - 9 levels of depth are summarized below.

| Depth | Total Topics | Number of Topics per Level| Perplexity Score |
|----------|-------------:|------:|------:|
| 3|  393 | 1, 80, 312    | 3921.60 | 
| **4**|  **522** | **1, 29, 83, 409**     | **3622.80** | 
| 5|  555 | 1, 15, 39, 97, 403     | 3645.70 | 
| 6|  742 | 1, 17, 31, 69, 167, 457     | 3697.96 | 
| 7|  662 | 1, 8, 15, 32, 55, 134, 417    | 3928.90 | 
| 8|  807 | 1, 4, 12, 21, 39, 77, 166, 487    | 3867.75 | 
| 9|  1077 | 1, 5, 9, 11, 32, 77, 121, 243, 578   | 3996.23 | 

An example of topics taken from each of the 4-levels is shown below. Each topic is shown as a node labeled with its top 10 keywords; the edges connect parent topics (top) to children topics (below) and are weighted by the number of documents assigned to each topic.

### Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
The NMF approach (Arora et al., 2013) has been shown to produce higher quality topics for smaller or sparser datasets. We generate the NMF models using [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and use an initialization procedure called Nonnegative Double Singular Value Decomposition (nndsvd), which is appropriate for sparse data (e.g. document titles, abstracts only). We fit the models using the tf-idf features that we previously calculated. We test the same range of topics (2 - 100) as we did previously to determine models yielding the highest coherence scores; NMF produces models with higher coherence scores than the LDA models. Following our heuristics, the model with the highest coherence score in the first level of thematic granularity (between 5 - 9 topics) has **9 topics** and the model with the highest coherence score in the second level (between 25 - 81 topics) has **70 topics**. The findings are summarized below. 

<img src="figures/NMF-coherence.png" alt="LDA-coherence" width="500"/>

| Number of Topics| Coherence Score (0 - 1) |
|-------------:|------:|
| **70** | **0.7077** |
| 71 | 0.7063 |
| 74 | 0.7069 |
| 80 | 0.705 |
| 82 | 0.7064 |
| **9** | **0.5966** |
| 8 | 0.5828 |
| 7 | 0.5576 |
| 6 | 0.5200 |
| 5 | 0.5009 |

We adopt the NMF topic modeling approach at two-levels of thematic granularity: **a first level (5-9 topics)** and **a second level (25-81 topics)**. Our approach allows us to dynamically produce topic models with any number of topics within each of these ranges. We keep these levels of thematic granularity in mind as we spatialize the NMF topic model as they inform usability constraints (e.g. the number of chunks of information that reviewers are able to keep in mind). 

## Spatialization

The topic models yield three main units around which the spatializations can be oriented: topics, documents, and keywords. While there are many possible and interesting configurations of these units, our primary goal is to address the following questions:

1. How have ERIâ€™s research **topics** changed over time? How are the topics related hierarchically?
2. Which of ERI research **documents** (publications, projects) are similar? (based on topic signatures, based on **keywords** shared in common)

These questions and conceptualizations suggest two distinct views of ERI's body of research. Using the most coherent topic models we selected at each level of thematic granularity, we develop spatial views of ERI's body of research. We structure these views along the lines of Franco Moretti's (2007) abstract models for literary history, which support "distant reading" of the corpus in the form of:

- **Maps:** objects (documents) embedded in relative topic space (neighborhoods)
- **Trees:** nodes (topics or documents), edges (documents or keywords) showing relationships (topic hierarchy or document/PI network)

### t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE)

The goal of mapping is to give an impression of the underlying thematic structure of the data. t-SNE (Maaten and Hinton, 2008) is a dimensionality reduction technique developed for mapping high dimensional objects. Alternative approaches including multidimensional scaling and isomap, also support this; however, t-SNE preserves the local structure in the data, producing meaningful local clusters of similar objects. It is appropriate for our purposes as we would like to map research documents that are associated with mixtures of topics in a way that spatially arranges thematically similar documents into meaningful clusters, or neighborhoods. 

We generate the t-SNE maps with [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/). We take topic models resulting from non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and fit them to the tf-idf matrix. We then transform the fitted topic model into a series of coordinates to map with t-SNE. The key parameters that we control are *perplexity* (5-50), which defines the number of nearest neighbors, and *early_exaggeration* (default: 12.0), which determines the compactness of resulting clusters and the space between them. We choose a perplexity of 7 and early exaggeration of 5 for the t-SNE map shown below. 

<img src="figures/NMF-t-SNE-9-topic.png" alt="LDA-coherence" width="600"/>

### Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP)

We also experiment with UMAP (McInnes et al., 2018), a more recently developed dimensionality reduction technique that shares similarities with t-SNE and improves upon it. It has been shown to scale better than t-SNE and importantly (for our purposes), UMAP preserves global data structure. With t-SNE, between-cluster similarities are not guaranteed to be preserved. Finally, t-SNE cannot work directly with high-dimensional data, but must go through a pre-processing step; this transformation is not necessary in UMAP. We generate a map (shown below) that uses the same NMF topic model, to compare the spatial layout and clustering of UMAP with t-SNE on our data. 

We use [umap-learn](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to generate the UMAP maps. The process for transforming the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and fitting it to the tf-idf matrix is nearly identical to that of t-SNE; however, UMAP doesn't require a secondary transformation to fit the topic model from NMF into coordinates for plotting. The key parameters are *n_neighbors* (default=15), which defines the number of neighbors (and is similar to *perplexity* in t-SNE), *min_dist* (default=0.1), which controls how tightly the clusters are packed (and is similar to *early exaggeration* in t-SNE), and *metric* (cosine, euclidean...), which determines how distance is computed. We choose n_neighbors of 10 and min_dist of 0.1. Interactive prototypes of these plots created with [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/index.html) are also available in this repository.
